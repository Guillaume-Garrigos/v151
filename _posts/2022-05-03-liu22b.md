title: " Strategic ranking "
abstract: " Strategic classification studies the design of a classifier robust to
  the manipulation of input by strategic individuals. However, the existing literature
  does not consider the effect of competition among individuals as induced by the
  algorithm design. Motivated by constrained allocation settings such as college admissions,
  we introduce strategic ranking, in which the (designed) individual reward depends
  on an applicantâ€™s post-effort rank in a measurement of interest. Our results illustrate
  how competition among applicants affects the resulting equilibria and model insights.
  We analyze how various ranking reward designs, belonging to a family of step functions,
  trade off applicant, school, and societal utility, as well as how ranking design
  counters inequities arising from disparate access to resources. In particular, we
  find that randomization in the reward design can mitigate two measures of disparate
  impact, welfare gap and access. "
