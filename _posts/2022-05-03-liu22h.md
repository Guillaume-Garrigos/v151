title: " Entropy Regularized Optimal Transport Independence Criterion "
abstract: " We introduce an independence criterion based on entropy regularized optimal
  transport. Our criterion can be used to test for independence between two samples.
  We establish non-asymptotic bounds for our test statistic and study its statistical
  behavior under both the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. The theoretical
  results involve tools from U-process theory and optimal transport theory. We also
  offer a random feature type approximation for large-scale problems, as well as a
  differentiable program implementation for deep learning applications. We present
  experimental results on existing benchmarks for independence testing, illustrating
  the interest of the proposed criterion to capture both linear and nonlinear dependencies
  in synthetic data and real data. "
