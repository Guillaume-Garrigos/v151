title: " AdaBlock: SGD with Practical Block Diagonal Matrix Adaptation for Deep Learning "
abstract: " We introduce AdaBlock, a class of adaptive gradient methods that extends
  popular approaches such as Adam by adopting the simple and natural idea of using
  block-diagonal matrix adaption to effectively utilize structural characteristics
  of deep learning architectures. Unlike other quadratic or block-diagonal approaches,
  AdaBlock has complete freedom to select block-diagonal groups, providing a wider
  trade-off applicable even to extremely high-dimensional problems. We provide convergence
  and generalization error bounds for AdaBlock, and study both theoretically and empirically
  the impact of the block size on the bounds and advantages over usual diagonal approaches.
  In addition, we propose a randomized layer-wise variant of Adablock to further reduce
  computations and memory footprint, and devise an efficient spectrum-clipping scheme
  for AdaBlock to benefit from Sgdâ€™s superior generalization performance. Extensive
  experiments on several deep learning tasks demonstrate the benefits of block diagonal
  adaptation compared to adaptive diagonal methods, vanilla Sgd, as well as modified
  versions of full-matrix adaptation. "
