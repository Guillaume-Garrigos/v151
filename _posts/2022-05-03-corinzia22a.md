title: " Statistical and computational thresholds for the planted k-densest sub-hypergraph
  problem "
abstract: " In this work, we consider the problem of recovery a planted k-densest
  sub-hypergraph on d-uniform hypergraphs. This fundamental problem appears in different
  contexts, e.g., community detection, average-case complexity, and neuroscience applications
  as a structural variant of tensor-PCA problem. We provide tight information-theoretic
  upper and lower bounds for the exact recovery threshold by the maximum-likelihood
  estimator, as well as algorithmic bounds based on approximate message passing algorithms.
  The problem exhibits a typical statistical-to-computational gap observed in analogous
  sparse settings that widen with increasing sparsity of the problem. The bounds show
  that the signal structure impacts the location of the statistical and computational
  phase transition that the known existing bounds for the tensor-PCA model do not
  capture. This effect is due to the generic planted signal prior that this latter
  model addresses. "
