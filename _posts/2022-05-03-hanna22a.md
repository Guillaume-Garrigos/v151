title: " Solving Multi-Arm Bandit Using a Few Bits of Communication "
abstract: " The multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is an active learning framework that
  aims to select the best among a set of actions by sequentially observing rewards.
  Recently, it has become popular for a number of applications over wireless networks,
  where communication constraints can form a bottleneck. Existing works usually fail
  to address this issue and can become infeasible in certain applications. In this
  paper we address the communication problem by optimizing the communication of rewards
  collected by distributed agents. By providing nearly matching upper and lower bounds,
  we tightly characterize the number of bits needed per reward for the learner to
  accurately learn without suffering additional regret. In particular, we establish
  a generic reward quantization algorithm, QuBan, that can be applied on top of any
  (no-regret) MAB algorithm to form a new communication-efficient counterpart, that
  requires only a few (as low as 3) bits to be sent per iteration while preserving
  the same regret bound. Our lower bound is established via constructing hard instances
  from a subgaussian distribution. Our theory is further corroborated by numerically
  experiments. "
