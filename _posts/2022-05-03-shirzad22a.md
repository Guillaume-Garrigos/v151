title: " TD-GEN: Graph Generation Using Tree Decomposition "
abstract: " We propose TD-GEN, a graph generation framework based on tree decomposition,
  and introduce a reduced upper bound on the maximum number of decisions needed for
  graph generation. The framework includes a permutation invariant tree generation
  model which forms the backbone of graph generation. Tree nodes are supernodes, each
  representing a cluster of nodes in the graph. Graph nodes and edges are incrementally
  generated inside the clusters by traversing the tree supernodes, respecting the
  structure of the tree decomposition, and following node sharing decisions between
  the clusters. Further, we discuss the shortcomings of the standard evaluation criteria
  based on statistical properties of the generated graphs. We propose to compare the
  generalizability of models based on expected likelihood. Empirical results on a
  variety of standard graph generation datasets demonstrate the superior performance
  of our method. "
