title: " Practical Schemes for Finding Near-Stationary Points of Convex Finite-Sums "
abstract: " In convex optimization, the problem of finding near-stationary points
  has not been adequately studied yet, unlike other optimality measures such as the
  function value. Even in the deterministic case, the optimal method (OGM-G, due to
  Kim and Fessler (2021)) has just been discovered recently. In this work, we conduct
  a systematic study of algorithmic techniques for finding near-stationary points
  of convex finite-sums. Our main contributions are several algorithmic discoveries:
  (1) we discover a memory-saving variant of OGM-G based on the performance estimation
  problem approach (Drori and Teboulle, 2014); (2) we design a new accelerated SVRG
  variant that can simultaneously achieve fast rates for minimizing both the gradient
  norm and function value; (3) we propose an adaptively regularized accelerated SVRG
  variant, which does not require the knowledge of some unknown initial constants
  and achieves near-optimal complexities. We put an emphasis on the simplicity and
  practicality of the new schemes, which could facilitate future work. "
