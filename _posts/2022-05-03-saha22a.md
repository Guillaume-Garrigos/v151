title: " Exploiting Correlation to Achieve Faster Learning Rates in Low-Rank Preference
  Bandits "
abstract: " We introduce the Correlated Preference Bandits problem with random utility-based
  choice models (RUMs), where the goal is to identify the best item from a given pool
  of $n$ items through online subsetwise preference feedback. We investigate whether
  models with a simple correlation structure, e.g. low rank, can result in faster
  learning rates. While we show that the problem can be impossible to solve for the
  general ‘low rank’ choice models, faster learning rates can be attained assuming
  more structured item correlations. In particular, we introduce a new class of Block-Rank
  based RUM model, where the best item is shown to be $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-PAC learnable
  with only $O(r \\epsilon^{-2} \\log(n/\\delta))$ samples. This improves on the standard
  sample complexity bound of $\\tilde{O}(n\\epsilon^{-2} \\log(1/\\delta))$ known
  for the usual learning algorithms which might not exploit the item-correlations
  ($r \\ll n$). We complement the above sample complexity with a matching lower bound
  (up to logarithmic factors), justifying the tightness of our analysis. Further,
  we extend the results to a more general noisy Block-Rank model, which ensures robustness
  of our techniques. Overall, our results justify the advantage of playing subsetwise
  queries over pairwise preferences $(k=2)$, we show the latter provably fails to
  exploit correlation. "
