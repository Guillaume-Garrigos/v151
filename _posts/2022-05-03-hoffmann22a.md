title: " Lifted Division for Lifted Hugin Belief Propagation "
abstract: " The lifted junction tree algorithm (LJT) is an inference algorithm that
  allows for tractable inference regarding domain sizes. To answer multiple queries
  efficiently, it decomposes a first-order input model into a first-order junction
  tree. During inference, degrees of belief are propagated through the tree. This
  propagation significantly contributes to the runtime complexity not just of LJT
  but of any tree-based inference algorithm. We present a lifted propagation scheme
  based on the so-called Hugin scheme whose runtime complexity is independent of the
  degree of the tree. Thereby, lifted Hugin can achieve asymptotic speed improvements
  over the existing lifted Shafer-Shenoy propagation. An empirical evaluation confirms
  these results. "
