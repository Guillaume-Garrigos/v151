title: " Estimators of Entropy and Information via Inference in Probabilistic Models "
abstract: " Estimating information-theoretic quantities such as entropy and mutual
  information is central to many problems in statistics and machine learning, but
  challenging in high dimensions. This paper presents <em>estimators of entropy via
  inference</em> (EEVI), which deliver upper and lower bounds on many information
  quantities for arbitrary variables in a probabilistic generative model. These estimators
  use importance sampling with proposal distribution families that include amortized
  variational inference and sequential Monte Carlo, which can be tailored to the target
  model and used to squeeze true information values with high accuracy. We present
  several theoretical properties of EEVI and demonstrate scalability and efficacy
  on two problems from the medical domain: (i) in an expert system for diagnosing
  liver disorders, we rank medical tests according to how informative they are about
  latent diseases, given a pattern of observed symptoms and patient attributes; and
  (ii) in a differential equation model of carbohydrate metabolism, we find optimal
  times to take blood glucose measurements that maximize information about a diabetic
  patientâ€™s insulin sensitivity, given their meal and medication schedule. "
