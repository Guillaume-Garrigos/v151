title: " Modelling Non-Smooth Signals with Complex Spectral Structure "
abstract: " The Gaussian Process Convolution Model (GPCM; Tobar et al., 2015a) is
  a model for signals with complex spectral structure. A significant limitation of
  the GPCM is that it assumes a rapidly decaying spectrum: it can only model smooth
  signals. Moreover, inference in the GPCM currently requires (1) a mean-field assumption,
  resulting in poorly calibrated uncertainties, and (2) a tedious variational optimisation
  of large covariance matrices. We redesign the GPCM model to induce a richer distribution
  over the spectrum with relaxed assumptions about smoothness: the Causal Gaussian
  Process Convolution Model (CGPCM) introduces a causality assumption into the GPCM,
  and the Rough Gaussian Process Convolution Model (RGPCM) can be interpreted as a
  Bayesian nonparametric generalisation of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
  We also propose a more effective variational inference scheme, going beyond the
  mean-field assumption: we design a Gibbs sampler which directly samples from the
  optimal variational solution, circumventing any variational optimisation entirely.
  The proposed variations of the GPCM are validated in experiments on synthetic and
  real-world data, showing promising results. "
