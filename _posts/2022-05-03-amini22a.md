title: " On perfectness in Gaussian graphical models "
abstract: " Knowing when a graphical model perfectly encodes the conditional independence
  structure of a distribution is essential in applications, and this is particularly
  important when performing inference from data. When the model is perfect, there
  is a one-to-one correspondence between conditional independence statements in the
  distribution and separation statements in the graph. Previous work has shown that
  almost all models based on linear directed acyclic graphs as well as Gaussian chain
  graphs are perfect, the latter of which subsumes Gaussian graphical models (i.e.,
  the undirected Gaussian models) as a special case. In this paper, we directly approach
  the problem of perfectness for the Gaussian graphical models, and provide a new
  proof, via a more transparent parametrization, that almost all such models are perfect.
  Our approach is based on, and substantially extends, a construction of Lněnička
  and Matúš showing the existence of a perfect Gaussian distribution for any graph.
  The analysis involves constructing a probability measure on the set of normalized
  covariance matrices Markov with respect to a graph that may be of independent interest. "
