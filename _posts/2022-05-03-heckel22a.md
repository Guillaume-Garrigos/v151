title: " Provable Continual Learning via Sketched Jacobian Approximations "
abstract: " An important problem in machine learning is the ability to learn tasks
  in a sequential manner. If trained with standard first-order methods most models
  forget previously learned tasks when trained on a new task, which is often referred
  to as catastrophic forgetting. A popular approach to overcome forgetting is to regularize
  the loss function by penalizing models that perform poorly on previous tasks. For
  example, elastic weight consolidation (EWC) regularizes with a quadratic form involving
  a diagonal matrix build based on past data. While EWC works very well for some setups,
  we show that, even under otherwise ideal conditions, it can provably suffer catastrophic
  forgetting if the diagonal matrix is a poor approximation of the Hessian matrix
  of previous tasks. We propose a simple approach to overcome this: Regularizing training
  of a new task with sketches of the Jacobian matrix of past data. This provably enables
  overcoming catastrophic forgetting for linear models and for wide neural networks,
  at the cost of memory. The overarching goal of this paper is to provided insights
  on when regularization-based continual learning algorithms work and under what memory
  costs. "
