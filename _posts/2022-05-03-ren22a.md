title: " Towards Statistical and Computational Complexities of Polyak Step Size Gradient
  Descent "
abstract: " We study the statistical and computational complexities of the Polyak
  step size gradient descent algorithm under generalized smoothness and {≈Å}ojasiewicz
  conditions of the population loss function, namely, the limit of the empirical loss
  function when the sample size goes to infinity, and the stability between the gradients
  of the empirical and population loss functions, namely, the polynomial growth on
  the concentration bound between the gradients of sample and population loss functions.
  We demonstrate that the Polyak step size gradient descent iterates reach a final
  statistical radius of convergence around the true parameter after logarithmic number
  of iterations in terms of the sample size. It is computationally cheaper than the
  polynomial number of iterations on the sample size of the fixed-step size gradient
  descent algorithm to reach the same final statistical radius when the population
  loss function is not locally strongly convex. Finally, we illustrate our general
  theory under three statistical examples: generalized linear model, mixture model,
  and mixed linear regression model. "
