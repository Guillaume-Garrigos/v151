title: " Robust Bayesian Inference for Simulator-based Models via the MMD Posterior
  Bootstrap "
abstract: " Simulator-based models are models for which the likelihood is intractable
  but simulation of synthetic data is possible. They are often used to describe complex
  real-world phenomena, and as such can often be misspecified in practice. Unfortunately,
  existing Bayesian approaches for simulators are known to perform poorly in those
  cases. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on the posterior bootstrap
  and maximum mean discrepancy estimators. This leads to a highly-parallelisable Bayesian
  inference algorithm with strong robustness properties. This is demonstrated through
  an in-depth theoretical study which includes generalisation bounds and proofs of
  frequentist consistency and robustness of our posterior. The approach is then assessed
  on a range of examples including a g-and-k distribution and a toggle-switch model. "
