title: ' Online Control of the False Discovery Rate under "Decision Deadlines" '
abstract: " Online testing procedures aim to control the extent of false discoveries
  over a sequence of hypothesis tests, allowing for the possibility that early-stage
  test results influence the choice of hypotheses to be tested in later stages. Typically,
  online methods assume that a permanent decision regarding the current test (reject
  or not reject) must be made before advancing to the next test. We instead assume
  that each hypothesis requires an immediate preliminary decision, but also allows
  us to update that decision until a preset deadline. Roughly speaking, this lets
  us apply a Benjamini-Hochberg-type procedure over a moving window of hypotheses,
  where the threshold parameters for upcoming tests can be determined based on preliminary
  results. We show that our approach can control the false discovery rate (FDR) at
  every stage of testing, even under arbitrary p-value dependencies. That said, our
  approach offers much greater flexibility if the p-values exhibit a known independence
  structure. For example, if the p-value sequence is finite and all p-values are independent,
  then we can additionally control FDR at adaptively chosen stopping times. "
