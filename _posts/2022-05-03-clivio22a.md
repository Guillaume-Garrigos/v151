title: " Neural score matching for high-dimensional causal inference "
abstract: " Traditional methods for matching in causal inference are impractical for
  high-dimensional datasets. They suffer from the curse of dimensionality: exact matching
  and coarsened exact matching find exponentially fewer matches as the input dimension
  grows, and propensity score matching may match highly unrelated units together.
  To overcome this problem, we develop theoretical results which motivate the use
  of neural networks to obtain non-trivial, multivariate balancing scores of a chosen
  level of coarseness, in contrast to the classical, scalar propensity score. We leverage
  these balancing scores to perform matching for high-dimensional causal inference
  and call this procedure neural score matching. We show that our method is competitive
  against other matching approaches on semi-synthetic high-dimensional datasets, both
  in terms of treatment effect estimation and reducing imbalance. "
