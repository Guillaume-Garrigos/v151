title: " SHAFF: Fast and consistent SHApley eFfect estimates via random Forests "
abstract: " Interpretability of learning algorithms is crucial for applications involving
  critical decisions, and variable importance is one of the main interpretation tools.
  Shapley effects are now widely used to interpret both tree ensembles and neural
  networks, as they can efficiently handle dependence and interactions in the data,
  as opposed to most other variable importance measures. However, estimating Shapley
  effects is a challenging task, because of the computational complexity and the conditional
  expectation estimates. Accordingly, existing Shapley algorithms have flaws: a costly
  running time, or a bias when input variables are dependent. Therefore, we introduce
  SHAFF, SHApley eFfects via random Forests, a fast and accurate Shapley effect estimate,
  even when input variables are dependent. We show SHAFF efficiency through both a
  theoretical analysis of its consistency, and the practical performance improvements
  over competitors with extensive experiments. An implementation of SHAFF in C++ and
  R is available online. "
