title: " A Bandit Model for Human-Machine Decision Making with Private Information
  and Opacity "
abstract: " Applications of machine learning inform human decision makers in a broad
  range of tasks. The resulting problem is usually formulated in terms of a single
  decision maker. We argue that it should rather be described as a two-player learning
  problem where one player is the machine and the other the human. While both players
  try to optimize the final decision, the setup is often characterized by (1) the
  presence of private information and (2) opacity, that is imperfect understanding
  between the decision makers. We prove that both properties can complicate decision
  making considerably. A lower bound quantifies the worst-case hardness of optimally
  advising a decision maker who is opaque or has access to private information. An
  upper bound shows that a simple coordination strategy is nearly minimax optimal.
  More efficient learning is possible under certain assumptions on the problem, for
  example that both players learn to take actions independently. Such assumptions
  are implicit in existing literature, for example in medical applications of machine
  learning, but have not been described or justified theoretically. "
