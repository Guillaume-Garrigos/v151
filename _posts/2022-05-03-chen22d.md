title: " Is Bayesian Model-Agnostic Meta Learning Better than Model-Agnostic Meta
  Learning, Provably? "
abstract: " Meta learning aims at learning a model that can quickly adapt to unseen
  tasks. Widely used meta learning methods include model agnostic meta learning (MAML),
  implicit MAML, Bayesian MAML. Thanks to its ability of modeling uncertainty, Bayesian
  MAML often has advantageous empirical performance. However, the theoretical understanding
  of Bayesian MAML is still limited, especially on questions such as if and when Bayesian
  MAML has provably better performance than MAML. In this paper, we aim to provide
  theoretical justifications for Bayesian MAMLâ€™s advantageous performance by comparing
  the meta test risks of MAML and Bayesian MAML. In the meta linear regression, under
  both the distribution agnostic and linear centroid cases, we have established that
  Bayesian MAML indeed has provably lower meta test risks than MAML. We verify our
  theoretical results through experiments, the code of which is available at https://github.com/lishachen/Bayesian-MAML-vs-MAML. "
