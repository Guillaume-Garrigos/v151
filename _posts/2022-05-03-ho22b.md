title: " Weak Separation in Mixture Models and Implications for Principal Stratification "
abstract: " Principal stratification is a popular framework for addressing post-randomization
  complications, often in conjunction with finite mixture models for estimating the
  causal effects of interest. Unfortunately, standard estimators of mixture parameters,
  like the MLE, are known to exhibit pathological behavior. We study this behavior
  in a simple but fundamental example, a two-component Gaussian mixture model in which
  only the component means and variances are unknown, and focus on the setting in
  which the components are weakly separated. In this case, we show that the asymptotic
  convergence rate of the MLE is quite poor, such as $O(n^{-1/6})$ or even $O(n^{-1/8})$.
  We then demonstrate via both theoretical arguments and extensive simulations that
  the MLE behaves like a threshold estimator in finite samples, in the sense that
  the MLE can give strong evidence that the means are equal when the truth is otherwise.
  We also explore the behavior of the MLE when the MLE is non-zero, showing that it
  is difficult to estimate both the sign and magnitude of the means in this case.
  We provide diagnostics for all of these pathologies and apply these ideas to re-analyzing
  two randomized evaluations of job training programs, JOBS II and Job Corps. Our
  results suggest that the corresponding maximum likelihood estimates should be interpreted
  with caution in these cases. "
