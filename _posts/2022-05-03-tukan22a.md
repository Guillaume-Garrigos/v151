title: " New Coresets for Projective Clustering and Applications "
abstract: " $(j,k)$-projective clustering is the natural generalization of the family
  of $k$-clustering and $j$-subspace clustering problems. Given a set of points $P$
  in $\\mathbb{R}^d$, the goal is to find $k$ flats of dimension $j$, i.e., affine
  subspaces, that best fit $P$ under a given distance measure. In this paper, we propose
  the first algorithm that returns an $L_\\infty$ coreset of size polynomial in $d$.
  Moreover, we give the first strong coreset construction for general $M$-estimator
  regression. Specifically, we show that our construction provides efficient coreset
  constructions for Cauchy, Welsch, Huber, Geman-McClure, Tukey, $L_1-L_2$, and Fair
  regression, as well as general concave and power-bounded loss functions. Finally,
  we provide experimental results based on real-world datasets, showing the efficacy
  of our approach. "
