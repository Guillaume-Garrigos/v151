title: " Fundamental limits for rank-one matrix estimation with groupwise heteroskedasticity "
abstract: " Low-rank matrix recovery problems involving high-dimensional and heterogeneous
  data appear in applications throughout statistics and machine learning. The contribution
  of this paper is to establish the fundamental limits of recovery for a broad class
  of these problems. In particular, we study the problem of estimating a rank-one
  matrix from Gaussian observations where different blocks of the matrix are observed
  under different noise levels. In the setting where the number of blocks is fixed
  while the number of variables tends to infinity, we prove asymptotically exact formulas
  for the minimum mean-squared error in estimating both the matrix and underlying
  factors. These results are based on a novel reduction from the low-rank matrix tensor
  product model (with homogeneous noise) to a rank-one model with heteroskedastic
  noise. As an application of our main result, we show that show recently proposed
  methods based on applying principal component analysis (PCA) to weighted combinations
  of the data are optimal in some settings but sub-optimal in others. We also provide
  numerical results comparing our asymptotic formulas with the performance of methods
  based weighted PCA, gradient descent, and approximate message passing. "
