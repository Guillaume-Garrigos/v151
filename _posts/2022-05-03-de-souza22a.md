title: " Parallel MCMC Without Embarrassing Failures "
abstract: " Embarrassingly parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) exploits parallel
  computing to scale Bayesian inference to large datasets by using a two-step approach.
  First, MCMC is run in parallel on (sub)posteriors defined on data partitions. Then,
  a server combines local results. While efficient, this framework is very sensitive
  to the quality of subposterior sampling. Common sampling problems such as missing
  modes or misrepresentation of low-density regions are amplified – instead of being
  corrected – in the combination phase, leading to catastrophic failures. In this
  work, we propose a novel combination strategy to mitigate this issue. Our strategy,
  Parallel Active Inference (PAI), leverages Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate modeling
  and active learning. After fitting GPs to subposteriors, PAI (i) shares information
  between GP surrogates to cover missing modes; and (ii) uses active sampling to individually
  refine subposterior approximations. We validate PAI in challenging benchmarks, including
  heavy-tailed and multi-modal posteriors and a real-world application to computational
  neuroscience. Empirical results show that PAI succeeds where previous methods catastrophically
  fail, with a small communication overhead. "
