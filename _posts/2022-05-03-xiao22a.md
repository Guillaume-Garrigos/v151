title: " Tile Networks: Learning Optimal Geometric Layout for Whole-page Recommendation "
abstract: " Finding optimal configurations in a geometric space is a key challenge
  in many technological disciplines. Current approaches either rely heavily on human
  domain expertise and are difficult to scale. In this paper we show it is possible
  to solve configuration optimization problems for whole-page recommendation using
  reinforcement learning. The proposed Tile Networks is a neural architecture that
  optimizes 2D geometric configurations by arranging items on proper positions. Empirical
  results on real dataset demonstrate its superior performance compared to traditional
  learning to rank approaches and recent deep models. "
