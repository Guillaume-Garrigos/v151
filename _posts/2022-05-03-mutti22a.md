title: " Reward-Free Policy Space Compression for Reinforcement Learning "
abstract: " In reinforcement learning, we encode the potential behaviors of an agent
  interacting with an environment into an infinite set of policies, called policy
  space, typically represented by a family of parametric functions. Dealing with such
  a policy space is a hefty challenge, which often causes sample and computational
  inefficiencies. However, we argue that a limited number of policies are actually
  relevant when we also account for the structure of the environment and of the policy
  parameterization, as many of them would induce very similar interactions, i.e.,
  state-action distributions. In this paper, we seek for a reward-free compression
  of the policy space into a finite set of representative policies, such that, given
  any policy $\\pi$, the minimum RÃ©nyi divergence between the state-action distributions
  of the representative policies and the state-action distribution of $\\pi$ is bounded.
  We show that this compression of the policy space can be formulated as a set cover
  problem, and it is inherently NP-hard. Nonetheless, we propose a game-theoretic
  reformulation for which a locally optimal solution can be efficiently found by iteratively
  stretching the compressed space to cover the most challenging policy. Finally, we
  provide an empirical evaluation to illustrate the compression procedure in simple
  domains, and its ripple effects in reinforcement learning. "
