title: " Coresets for Data Discretization and Sine Wave Fitting "
abstract: " In the monitoring problem, the input is an unbounded stream $P={p_1,p_2\\cdots}$
  of integers in $[N]:=\\{1,\\cdots,N\\}$, that are obtained from a sensor (such as
  GPS or heart beats of a human). The goal (e.g., for anomaly detection) is to approximate
  the $n$ points received so far in $P$ by a single frequency $\\sin$, e.g. $\\min_{c\\in
  C}cost(P,c)+\\lambda(c)$, where $cost(P,c)=\\sum_{i=1}^n \\sin^2(\\frac{2\\pi}{N}
  p_ic)$, $C\\subseteq [N]$ is a feasible set of solutions, and $\\lambda$ is a given
  regularization function. For any approximation error $\\varepsilon>0$, we prove
  that every set $P$ of $n$ integers has a weighted subset $S\\subseteq P$ (sometimes
  called core-set) of cardinality $|S|\\in O(\\log(N)^{O(1)})$ that approximates $cost(P,c)$
  (for every $c\\in [N]$) up to a multiplicative factor of $1\\pm\\varepsilon$. Using
  known coreset techniques, this implies streaming algorithms using only $O((\\log(N)\\log(n))^{O(1)})$
  memory. Our results hold for a large family of functions. Experimental results and
  open source code are provided. "
