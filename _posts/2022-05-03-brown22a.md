title: " Performative Prediction in a Stateful World "
abstract: " Deployed supervised machine learning models make predictions that interact
  with and influence the world. This phenomenon is called <em>performative prediction</em>
  by Perdomo et al. (ICML 2020). It is an ongoing challenge to understand the influence
  of such predictions as well as design tools so as to control that influence. We
  propose a theoretical framework where the response of a target population to the
  deployed classifier is modeled as a function of the classifier and the current state
  (distribution) of the population. We show necessary and sufficient conditions for
  convergence to an equilibrium of two retraining algorithms, <em>repeated risk minimization</em>
  and a lazier variant. Furthermore, convergence is near an optimal classifier. We
  thus generalize results of Perdomo et al., whose performativity framework does not
  assume any dependence on the state of the target population. A particular phenomenon
  captured by our model is that of distinct groups that acquire information and resources
  at different rates to be able to respond to the latest deployed classifier. We study
  this phenomenon theoretically and empirically. "
