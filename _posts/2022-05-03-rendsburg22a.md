title: " Discovering Inductive Bias with Gibbs Priors: A Diagnostic Tool for Approximate
  Bayesian Inference "
abstract: " Full Bayesian posteriors are rarely analytically tractable, which is why
  real-world Bayesian inference heavily relies on approximate techniques. Approximations
  generally differ from the true posterior and require diagnostic tools to assess
  whether the inference can still be trusted. We investigate a new approach to diagnosing
  approximate inference: the approximation mismatch is attributed to a change in the
  inductive bias by treating the approximations as exact and reverse-engineering the
  corresponding prior. We show that the problem is more complicated than it appears
  to be at first glance, because the solution generally depends on the observation.
  By reframing the problem in terms of incompatible conditional distributions we arrive
  at a natural solution: the Gibbs prior. The resulting diagnostic is based on pseudo-Gibbs
  sampling, which is widely applicable and easy to implement. We illustrate how the
  Gibbs prior can be used to discover the inductive bias in a controlled Gaussian
  setting and for a variety of Bayesian models and approximations. "
