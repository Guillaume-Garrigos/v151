title: " Deep Generative model with Hierarchical Latent Factors for Time Series Anomaly
  Detection "
abstract: " Multivariate time series anomaly detection has become an active area of
  research in recent years, with Deep Learning models outperforming previous approaches
  on benchmark datasets. Among reconstruction-based models, most previous work has
  focused on Variational Autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work
  presents DGHL, a new family of generative models for time series anomaly detection,
  trained by maximizing the observed likelihood by posterior sampling and alternating
  back-propagation. A top-down Convolution Network maps a novel hierarchical latent
  space to time series windows, exploiting temporal dynamics to encode information
  efficiently. Despite relying on posterior sampling, it is computationally more efficient
  than current approaches, with up to 10x shorter training times than RNN based models.
  Our method outperformed current state-of-the-art models on four popular benchmark
  datasets. Finally, DGHL is robust to variable features between entities and accurate
  even with large proportions of missing values, settings with increasing relevance
  with the advent of IoT. We demonstrate the superior robustness of DGHL with novel
  occlusion experiments in this literature. Our code is available at https://github.com/cchallu/dghl. "
