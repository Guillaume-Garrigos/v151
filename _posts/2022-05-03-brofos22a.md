title: " Adaptation of the Independent Metropolis-Hastings Sampler with Normalizing
  Flow Proposals "
abstract: " Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are a powerful tool for computation
  with complex probability distributions. However the performance of such methods
  is critically dependent on properly tuned parameters, most of which are difficult
  if not impossible to know a priori for a given target distribution. Adaptive MCMC
  methods aim to address this by allowing the parameters to be updated during sampling
  based on previous samples from the chain at the expense of requiring a new theoretical
  analysis to ensure convergence. In this work we extend the convergence theory of
  adaptive MCMC methods to a new class of methods built on a powerful class of parametric
  density estimators known as normalizing flows. In particular, we consider an independent
  Metropolis-Hastings sampler where the proposal distribution is represented by a
  normalizing flow whose parameters are updated using stochastic gradient descent.
  We explore the practical performance of this procedure on both synthetic settings
  and in the analysis of a physical field system, and compare it against both adaptive
  and non-adaptive MCMC methods. "
