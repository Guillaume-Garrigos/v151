title: " Policy Learning for Optimal Individualized Dose Intervals "
abstract: " We study the problem of learning individualized dose intervals using observational
  data. There are very few previous works for policy learning with continuous treatment,
  and all of them focused on recommending an optimal dose rather than an optimal dose
  interval. In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate such an optimal dose
  interval, named probability dose interval (PDI). The potential outcomes for doses
  in the PDI are guaranteed better than a pre-specified threshold with a given probability
  (e.g., $50%$). The associated nonconvex optimization problem can be efficiently
  solved by the Difference-of-Convex functions (DC) algorithm. We prove that our estimated
  policy is consistent, and its risk converges to that of the best-in-class policy
  at a root-n rate. Numerical simulations show the advantage of the proposed method
  over outcome modeling based benchmarks. We further demonstrate the performance of
  our method in determining individualized Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) control intervals
  for elderly patients with diabetes. "
