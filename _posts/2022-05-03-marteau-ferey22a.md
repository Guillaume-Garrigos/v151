title: " Sampling from Arbitrary Functions via PSD Models "
abstract: " In many areas of applied statistics and machine learning, generating an
  arbitrary number of inde- pendent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples from
  a given distribution is a key task. When the distribution is known only through
  evaluations of the density, current methods either scale badly with the dimension
  or require very involved implemen- tations. Instead, we take a two-step approach
  by first modeling the probability distribution and then sampling from that model.
  We use the recently introduced class of positive semi-definite (PSD) models which
  have been shown to be e "
