title: " Dimensionality Reduction and Prioritized Exploration for Policy Search "
abstract: " Black-box policy optimization is a class of reinforcement learning algorithms
  that explores and updates the policies at the parameter level. This class of algorithms
  is widely applied in robotics with movement primitives or non-differentiable policies.
  Furthermore, these approaches are particularly relevant where exploration at the
  action level could cause actuator damage or other safety issues. However, Black-box
  optimization does not scale well with the increasing dimensionality of the policy,
  leading to high demand for samples, which are expensive to obtain in real-world
  systems. In many practical applications, policy parameters do not contribute equally
  to the return. Identifying the most relevant parameters allows to narrow down the
  exploration and speed up the learning. Furthermore, updating only the effective
  parameters requires fewer samples, improving the scalability of the method. We present
  a novel method to prioritize the exploration of effective parameters and cope with
  full covariance matrix updates. Our algorithm learns faster than recent approaches
  and requires fewer samples to achieve state-of-the-art results. To select the effective
  parameters, we consider both the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Mutual
  Information. We showcase the capabilities of our approach on the Relative Entropy
  Policy Search algorithm in several simulated environments, including robotics simulations.
