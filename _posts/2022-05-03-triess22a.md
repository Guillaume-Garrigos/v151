title: " Point Cloud Generation with Continuous Conditioning "
abstract: " Generative models can be used to synthesize 3D objects of high quality
  and diversity. However, there is typically no control over the properties of the
  generated object.This paper proposes a novel generative adversarial network (GAN)
  setup that generates 3D point cloud shapes conditioned on a continuous parameter.
  In an exemplary application, we use this to guide the generative process to create
  a 3D object with a custom-fit shape. We formulate this generation process in a multi-task
  setting by using the concept of auxiliary classifier GANs. Further, we propose to
  sample the generator label input for training from a kernel density estimation (KDE)
  of the dataset. Our ablations show that this leads to significant performance increase
  in regions with few samples. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
  show that we gain explicit control over the object dimensions while maintaining
  good generation quality and diversity. "
