title: " Towards Return Parity in Markov Decision Processes "
abstract: " Algorithmic decisions made by machine learning models in high-stakes domains
  may have lasting impacts over time. However, naive applications of standard fairness
  criterion in static settings over temporal domains may lead to delayed and adverse
  effects. To understand the dynamics of performance disparity, we study a fairness
  problem in Markov decision processes (MDPs). Specifically, we propose return parity,
  a fairness notion that requires MDPs from different demographic groups that share
  the same state and action spaces to achieve approximately the same expected time-discounted
  rewards. We first provide a decomposition theorem for return disparity, which decomposes
  the return disparity of any two MDPs sharing the same state and action spaces into
  the distance between group-wise reward functions, the discrepancy of group policies,
  and the discrepancy between state visitation distributions induced by the group
  policies. Motivated by our decomposition theorem, we propose algorithms to mitigate
  return disparity via learning a shared group policy with state visitation distributional
  alignment using integral probability metrics. We conduct experiments to corroborate
  our results, showing that the proposed algorithm can successfully close the disparity
  gap while maintaining the performance of policies on two real-world recommender
  system benchmark datasets. "
