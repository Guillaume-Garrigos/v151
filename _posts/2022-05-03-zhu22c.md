title: " Optimal Accounting of Differential Privacy via Characteristic Function "
abstract: " Characterizing the privacy degradation over compositions, i.e., privacy
  accounting, is a fundamental topic in differential privacy (DP) with many applications
  to differentially private machine learning and federated learning. We propose a
  unification of recent advances (Renyi DP, privacy profiles, $f$-DP and the PLD formalism)
  via the characteristic function ($\\phi$-function) of a certain dominating privacy
  loss random variable. We show that our approach allows natural adaptive composition
  like Renyi DP, provides exactly tight privacy accounting like PLD, and can be (often
  losslessly) converted to privacy profile and $f$-DP, thus providing $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-DP
  guarantees and interpretable tradeoff functions. Algorithmically, we propose an
  analytical Fourier accountant that represents the complex logarithm of $\\phi$-functions
  symbolically and uses Gaussian quadrature for numerical computation. On several
  popular DP mechanisms and their subsampled counterparts, we demonstrate the flexibility
  and tightness of our approach in theory and experiments. "
