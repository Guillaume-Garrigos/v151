title: " Hypergraph Simultaneous Generators "
abstract: " Generative models for affiliation networks condition the edges on the
  membership of their nodes to communities. The problem of community detection under
  these models is addressed by inferring the membership parameters from the network
  structure. Current models make several unrealistic assumptions to make the inference
  feasible, and are mostly designed to work on regular graphs that cannot handle multi-way
  connections between nodes. While the models designed for hypergraphs attempt to
  capture the latter, they add further strict assumptions on the structure and size
  of hyperedges and are usually computationally intractable for real data. This paper
  proposes an efficient probabilistic generative model for detecting overlapping communities
  that process hyperedges without any changes or restrictions on their size. Our model
  represents the entire state space of the hyperedges, which is exponential in the
  number of nodes. We develop a mathematical computation reduction scheme that reduces
  the inference time to linear in the volume of the hypergraph without sacrificing
  precision. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness and scalability of
  our model and demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art
  community detection methods. "
