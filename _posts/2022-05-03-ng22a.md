title: " Towards Federated Bayesian Network Structure Learning with Continuous Optimization "
abstract: " Traditionally, Bayesian network structure learning is often carried out
  at a central site, in which all data is gathered. However, in practice, data may
  be distributed across different parties (e.g., companies, devices) who intend to
  collectively learn a Bayesian network, but are not willing to disclose information
  related to their data owing to privacy or security concerns. In this work, we present
  a federated learning approach to estimate the structure of Bayesian network from
  data that is horizontally partitioned across different parties. We develop a distributed
  structure learning method based on continuous optimization, using the alternating
  direction method of multipliers (ADMM), such that only the model parameters have
  to be exchanged during the optimization process. We demonstrate the flexibility
  of our approach by adopting it for both linear and nonlinear cases. Experimental
  results on synthetic and real datasets show that it achieves an improved performance
  over the other methods, especially when there is a relatively large number of clients
  and each has a limited sample size. "
