title: " Co-Regularized Adversarial Learning for Multi-Domain Text Classification "
abstract: " Multi-domain text classification (MDTC) aims to leverage all available
  resources from multiple domains to learn a predictive model that can generalize
  well on these domains. Recently, many MDTC methods adopt adversarial learning, shared-private
  paradigm, and entropy minimization to yield state-of-the-art results. However, these
  approaches face three issues: (1) Minimizing domain divergence can not fully guarantee
  the success of domain alignment; (2) Aligning marginal feature distributions can
  not fully guarantee the discriminability of the learned features; (3) Standard entropy
  minimization may make the predictions on unlabeled data over-confident, deteriorating
  the discriminability of the learned features. In order to address the above issues,
  we propose a co-regularized adversarial learning (CRAL) mechanism for MDTC. This
  approach constructs two diverse shared latent spaces, performs domain alignment
  in each of them, and punishes the disagreements of these two alignments with respect
  to the predictions on unlabeled data. Moreover, virtual adversarial training (VAT)
  with entropy minimization is incorporated to impose consistency regularization to
  the CRAL method. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods
  on two MDTC benchmarks. "
