title: " Sequential Multivariate Change Detection with Calibrated and Memoryless False
  Detection Rates "
abstract: " Responding appropriately to the detections of a sequential change detector
  requires knowledge of the rate at which false positives occur in the absence of
  change. Setting detection thresholds to achieve a desired false positive rate is
  challenging. Existing works resort to setting time-invariant thresholds that focus
  on the expected runtime of the detector in the absence of change, either bounding
  it loosely from below or targeting it directly but with asymptotic arguments that
  we show cause significant miscalibration in practice. We present a simulation-based
  approach to setting time-varying thresholds that allows a desired expected runtime
  to be accurately targeted whilst additionally keeping the false positive rate constant
  across time steps. Whilst the approach to threshold setting is metric agnostic,
  we show how the cost of using the popular quadratic time MMD estimator can be reduced
  from $O(N^2B)$ to $O(N^2+NB)$ during configuration and from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ during
  operation, where $N$ and $B$ are the numbers of reference and bootstrap samples
  respectively. "
