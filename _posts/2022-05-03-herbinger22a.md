title: " REPID: Regional Effect Plots with implicit Interaction Detection "
abstract: " Machine learning models can automatically learn complex relationships,
  such as non-linear and interaction effects. Interpretable machine learning methods
  such as partial dependence plots visualize marginal feature effects but may lead
  to misleading interpretations when feature interactions are present. Hence, employing
  additional methods that can detect and measure the strength of interactions is paramount
  to better understand the inner workings of machine learning models. We demonstrate
  several drawbacks of existing global interaction detection approaches, characterize
  them theoretically, and evaluate them empirically. Furthermore, we introduce regional
  effect plots with implicit interaction detection, a novel framework to detect interactions
  between a feature of interest and other features. The framework also quantifies
  the strength of interactions and provides interpretable and distinct regions in
  which feature effects can be interpreted more reliably, as they are less confounded
  by interactions. We prove the theoretical eligibility of our method and show its
  applicability on various simulation and real-world examples. "
