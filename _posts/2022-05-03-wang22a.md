title: " Physics Informed Deep Kernel Learning "
abstract: " Deep kernel learning is a promising combination of deep neural networks
  and nonparametric function estimation. However, as a data driven approach, the performance
  of deep kernel learning can still be restricted by scarce or insufficient data,
  especially in extrapolation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Physics
  Informed Deep Kernel Learning (PI-DKL) that exploits physics knowledge represented
  by differential equations with latent sources. Specifically, we use the posterior
  function sample of the Gaussian process as the surrogate for the solution of the
  differential equation, and construct a generative component to integrate the equation
  in a principled Bayesian hybrid framework. For efficient and effective inference,
  we marginalize out the latent variables in the joint probability and derive a collapsed
  model evidence lower bound (ELBO), based on which we develop a stochastic model
  estimation algorithm. Our ELBO can be viewed as a nice, interpretable posterior
  regularization objective. On synthetic datasets and real-world applications, we
  show the advantage of our approach in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.
