title: " Exact Community Recovery over Signed Graphs "
abstract: " Signed graphs encode similarity and dissimilarity relationships among
  different entities with positive and negative edges. In this paper, we study the
  problem of community recovery over signed graphs generated by the signed stochastic
  block model (SSBM) with two equal-sized communities. Our approach is based on the
  maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the SSBM. Unlike many existing approaches,
  our formulation reveals that the positive and negative edges of a signed graph should
  be treated unequally. We then propose a simple two-stage iterative algorithm for
  solving the regularized MLE. It is shown that in the logarithmic degree regime,
  the proposed algorithm can exactly recover the underlying communities in nearly-linear
  time at the information-theoretic limit. Numerical results on both synthetic and
  real data are reported to validate and complement our theoretical developments and
  demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. "
