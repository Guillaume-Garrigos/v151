title: " Warping Layer: Representation Learning for Label Structures in Weakly Supervised
  Learning "
abstract: " Many learning tasks only receive weak supervision, such as semi-supervised
  learning and few-shot learning. With limited labeled data, prior structures become
  especially important, and prominent examples include hierarchies and mutual exclusions
  in the class space. However, most existing approaches only learn the representations
  separately in the feature space and the label space, and do not explicitly enforce
  the logical relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel warping layer that
  jointly learns representations in both spaces, and thanks to the modularity and
  differentiability, it can be directly embedded into generative models to leverage
  the prior hierarchical structure and unlabeled data. The effectiveness of the warping
  layer is demonstrated on both few-shot and semi-supervised learning, outperforming
  the state of the art in practice. "
