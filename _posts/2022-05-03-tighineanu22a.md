title: " Transfer Learning with Gaussian Processes for Bayesian Optimization "
abstract: " Bayesian optimization is a powerful paradigm to optimize black-box functions
  based on scarce and noisy data. Its data efficiency can be further improved by transfer
  learning from related tasks. While recent transfer models meta-learn a prior based
  on large amount of data, in the low-data regime methods that exploit the closed-form
  posterior of Gaussian processes (GPs) have an advantage. In this setting, several
  analytically tractable transfer-model posteriors have been proposed, but the relative
  advantages of these methods are not well understood. In this paper, we provide a
  unified view on hierarchical GP models for transfer learning, which allows us to
  analyze the relationship between methods. As part of the analysis, we develop a
  novel closed-form boosted GP transfer model that fits between existing approaches
  in terms of complexity. We evaluate the performance of the different approaches
  in large-scale experiments and highlight strengths and weaknesses of the different
  transfer-learning methods. "
