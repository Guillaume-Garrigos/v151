title: " Feature screening with kernel knockoffs "
abstract: " This article analyses three feature screening procedures: Kendall’s Tau
  and Spearman Rho (TR), Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) and conditional
  Maximum Mean Discrepancy (cMMD), where the latter is a modified version of the standard
  MMD for categorical classification. These association measures are not based on
  any specific underlying model, such as the linear regression. We provide the conditions
  for which the sure independence screening (SIS) property is satisfied under a lower
  bound assumption on the minimum signal strength of the association measure. The
  SIS property for the HSIC and cMMD is established for given bounded and symmetric
  kernels. Within the high-dimensional setting, we propose a two-step approach to
  control the false discovery rate (FDR) using the knockoff filtering. The performances
  of the association measures are assessed through simulated and real data experiments
  and compared with existing competing screening methods. "
