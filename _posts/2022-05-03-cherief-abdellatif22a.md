title: " On PAC-Bayesian reconstruction guarantees for VAEs "
abstract: " Despite its wide use and empirical successes, the theoretical understanding
  and study of the behaviour and performance of the variational autoencoder (VAE)
  have only emerged in the past few years. We contribute to this recent line of work
  by analysing the VAE’s reconstruction ability for unseen test data, leveraging arguments
  from the PAC-Bayes theory. We provide generalisation bounds on the theoretical reconstruction
  error, and provide insights on the regularisation effect of VAE objectives. We illustrate
  our theoretical results with supporting experiments on classical benchmark datasets. "
