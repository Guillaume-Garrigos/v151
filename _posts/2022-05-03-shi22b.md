title: " On the Assumptions of Synthetic Control Methods "
abstract: ' Synthetic control (SC) methods have been widely applied to estimate the
  causal effect of large-scale interventions, e.g., the state-wide effect of a change
  in policy. The idea of synthetic controls is to approximate one unit’s counterfactual
  outcomes using a weighted combination of some other units’ observed outcomes. The
  motivating question of this paper is: how does the SC strategy lead to valid causal
  inferences? We address this question by re-formulating the causal inference problem
  targeted by SC with a more fine-grained model, where we change the unit of analysis
  from “large units" (e.g., states) to “small units" (e.g., individuals in states).
  Under the re-formulation, we derive sufficient conditions for the non-parametric
  causal identification of the causal effect. We show that, in some settings, existing
  linear SC estimators are valid even when the data generating process is non-linear.
  We highlight two implications of the reformulation: 1) it clarifies where “linearity"
  comes from, and how it falls naturally out of the more fine-grained and flexible
  model; 2) it suggests new ways of using available data with SC methods for valid
  causal inference, in particular, new ways of selecting observations from which to
  estimate the counterfactual. '
