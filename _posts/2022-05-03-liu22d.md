title: " CATVI: Conditional and Adaptively Truncated Variational Inference for Hierarchical
  Bayesian Nonparametric Models "
abstract: " Current variational inference methods for hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric
  models can neither characterize the correlation structure among latent variables
  due to the mean-field setting, nor infer the true posterior dimension because of
  the universal truncation. To overcome these limitations, we propose the conditional
  and adaptively truncated variational inference method (CATVI) by maximizing the
  nonparametric evidence lower bound and integrating Monte Carlo into the variational
  inference framework. CATVI enjoys several advantages over traditional methods, including
  a smaller divergence between variational and true posteriors, reduced risk of underfitting
  or overfitting, and improved prediction accuracy. Empirical studies on three large
  datasets reveal that CATVI applied in Bayesian nonparametric topic models substantially
  outperforms competing models, providing lower perplexity and clearer topic-words
  clustering. "
