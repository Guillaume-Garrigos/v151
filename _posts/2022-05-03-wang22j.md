title: " On a Connection Between Fast and Sparse Oblivious Subspace Embeddings "
abstract: " Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss Transform (FJLT) and Sparse Johnson-Lindenstrauss
  Transform (SJLT) are two important oblivious subspace embeddings. So far, the developments
  of these two methods are almost orthogonal. In this work, we propose an iterative
  algorithm for oblivious subspace embedding which makes a connection between these
  two methods. The proposed method is built upon an iterative implementation of FJLT
  and is equipped with several theoretically motivated modifications. One important
  strategy we adopt is the early stopping strategy. On the one hand, the early stopping
  strategy makes our algorithm fast. On the other hand, it results in a sparse embedding
  matrix. As a result, the proposed algorithm is not only faster than the FJLT, but
  also faster than the SJLT with the same degree of sparsity. We present a general
  theoretical framework to analyze the embedding property of sparse embedding methods,
  which is used to prove the embedding property of the proposed method. This framework
  is also of independent interest. Lastly, we conduct numerical experiments to verify
  the good performance of the proposed algorithm. "
