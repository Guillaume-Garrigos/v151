title: " Decoupling Local and Global Representations of Time Series "
abstract: " Real-world time series data are often generated from several sources of
  variation. Learning representations that capture the factors contributing to this
  variability enables better understanding of the data via its underlying generative
  process and can lead to improvements in performance on downstream machine learning
  tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel generative approach for learning representations
  for the global and local factors of variation in time series data. The local representation
  of each sample models non-stationarity over time with a stochastic process prior,
  and the global representation of the sample encodes the time-independent characteristics.
  To encourage decoupling between the representations, we introduce a counterfactual
  regularization that minimizes the mutual information between the two variables.
  In experiments, we demonstrate successful recovery of the true local and global
  factors of variability on simulated data, and show that representations learned
  using our method lead to superior performance on downstream tasks on real-world
  datasets. We believe that the proposed way of defining representations is beneficial
  for data modelling and can yield better insights into the complexity of the real-world
  data. "
