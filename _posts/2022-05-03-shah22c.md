title: " Learning and Generalization in Overparameterized Normalizing Flows "
abstract: " In supervised learning, it is known that overparameterized neural networks
  with one hidden layer provably and efficiently learn and generalize, when trained
  using stochastic gradient descent with a sufficiently small learning rate and suitable
  initialization. In contrast, the benefit of overparameterization in unsupervised
  learning is not well understood. Normalizing flows (NFs) constitute an important
  class of models in unsupervised learning for sampling and density estimation. In
  this paper, we theoretically and empirically analyze these models when the underlying
  neural network is a one-hidden-layer overparametrized network. Our main contributions
  are two-fold: (1) On the one hand, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence
  that for constrained NFs (this class of NFs underlies most NF constructions) with
  the one-hidden-layer network, overparametrization hurts training. (2) On the other
  hand, we prove that unconstrained NFs, a recently introduced model, can efficiently
  learn any reasonable data distribution under minimal assumptions when the underlying
  network is overparametrized and has one hidden-layer. "
