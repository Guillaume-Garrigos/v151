title: " Randomized Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent "
abstract: " An increasing number of machine learning problems, such as robust or adversarial
  variants of existing algorithms, require minimizing a loss function that is itself
  defined as a maximum. Carrying a loop of stochastic gradient ascent (SGA) steps
  on the (inner) maximization problem, followed by an SGD step on the (outer) minimization,
  is known as Epoch Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent (ESGDA). While successful in
  practice, the theoretical analysis of ESGDA remains challenging, with no clear guidance
  on choices for the inner loop size nor on the interplay between inner/outer step
  sizes. We propose RSGDA (Randomized SGDA), a variant of ESGDA with stochastic loop
  size with a simpler theoretical analysis. RSGDA comes with the first (among SGDA
  algorithms) almost sure convergence rates when used on nonconvex min/strongly-concave
  max settings. RSGDA can be parameterized using optimal loop sizes that guarantee
  the best convergence rates known to hold for SGDA. We test RSGDA on toy and larger
  scale problems, using distributionally robust optimization and single-cell data
  matching using optimal transport as a testbed. "
