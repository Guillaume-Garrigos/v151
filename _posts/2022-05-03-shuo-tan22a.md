title: " A cautionary tale on fitting decision trees to data from additive models:
  generalization lower bounds "
abstract: " Decision trees are important both as interpretable models amenable to
  high-stakes decision-making, and as building blocks of ensemble methods such as
  random forests and gradient boosting. Their statistical properties, however, are
  not well understood. The most cited prior works have focused on deriving pointwise
  consistency guarantees for CART in a classical nonparametric regression setting.
  We take a different approach, and advocate studying the generalization performance
  of decision trees with respect to different generative regression models. This allows
  us to elicit their inductive bias, that is, the assumptions the algorithms make
  (or do not make) to generalize to new data, thereby guiding practitioners on when
  and how to apply these methods. In this paper, we focus on sparse additive generative
  models, which have both low statistical complexity and some nonparametric flexibility.
  We prove a sharp squared error generalization lower bound for a large class of decision
  tree algorithms fitted to sparse additive models with $C^1$ component functions.
  This bound is surprisingly much worse than the minimax rate for estimating such
  sparse additive models. The inefficiency is due not to greediness, but to the loss
  in power for detecting global structure when we average responses solely over each
  leaf, an observation that suggests opportunities to improve tree-based algorithms,
  for example, by hierarchical shrinkage. To prove these bounds, we develop new technical
  machinery, establishing a novel connection between decision tree estimation and
  rate-distortion theory, a sub-field of information theory. "
