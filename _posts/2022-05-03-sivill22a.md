title: " LIMESegment: Meaningful, Realistic Time Series Explanations "
abstract: " LIME (Locally Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) has become a
  popular way of generating explanations for tabular, image and natural language models,
  providing insight into why an instance was given a particular classification. In
  this paper we adapt LIME to time series classification, an under-explored area with
  existing approaches failing to account for the structure of this kind of data. We
  frame the non-trivial challenge of adapting LIME to time series classification as
  the following open questions: “What is a meaningful interpretable representation
  of a time series?”, “How does one realistically perturb a time series?” and “What
  is a local neighbourhood around a time series?”. We propose solutions to all three
  questions and combine them into a novel time series explanation framework called
  LIMESegment, which outperforms existing adaptations of LIME to time series on a
  variety of classification tasks. "
