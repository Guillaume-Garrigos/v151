title: " Calibration Error for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects "
abstract: " Recently, many researchers have advanced data-driven methods for modeling
  heterogeneous treatment effects (HTEs). Even still, estimation of HTEs is a difficult
  taskâ€“these methods frequently over- or under-estimate the treatment effects, leading
  to poor calibration of the resulting models. However, while many methods exist for
  evaluating the calibration of prediction and classification models, formal approaches
  to assess the calibration of HTE models are limited to the calibration slope. In
  this paper, we define an analogue of the (L2) expected calibration error for HTEs,
  and propose a robust estimator. Our approach is motivated by doubly robust treatment
  effect estimators, making it unbiased, and resilient to confounding, overfitting,
  and high-dimensionality issues. Furthermore, our method is straightforward to adapt
  to many structures under which treatment effects can be identified, including randomized
  trials, observational studies, and survival analysis. We illustrate how to use our
  proposed metric to evaluate the calibration of learned HTE models through the application
  to the CRITEO-UPLIFT Trial. "
