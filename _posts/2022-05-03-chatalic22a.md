title: " Mean Nyström Embeddings for Adaptive Compressive Learning "
abstract: " Compressive learning is an approach to efficient large scale learning
  based on sketching an entire dataset to a single mean embedding (the sketch), i.e.
  a vector of generalized moments. The learning task is then approximately solved
  as an inverse problem using an adapted parametric model. Previous works in this
  context have focused on sketches obtained by averaging random features, that while
  universal can be poorly adapted to the problem at hand. In this paper, we propose
  and study the idea of performing sketching based on data-dependent Nyström approximation.
  From a theoretical perspective we prove that the excess risk can be controlled under
  a geometric assumption relating the parametric model used to learn from the sketch
  and the covariance operator associated to the task at hand. Empirically, we show
  for k-means clustering and Gaussian modeling that for a fixed sketch size, Nyström
  sketches indeed outperform those built with random features. "
