title: " Towards Agnostic Feature-based Dynamic Pricing: Linear Policies vs Linear
  Valuation with Unknown Noise "
abstract: ' In feature-based dynamic pricing, a seller sets appropriate prices for
  a sequence of products (described by feature vectors) on the fly by learning from
  the binary outcomes of previous sales sessions ("Sold" if valuation $\geq$ price,
  and "Not Sold" otherwise). Existing works either assume noiseless linear valuation
  or precisely-known noise distribution, which limits the applicability of those algorithms
  in practice when these assumptions are hard to verify. In this work, we study two
  more agnostic models: (a) a "linear policy" problem where we aim at competing with
  the best linear pricing policy while making no assumptions on the data, and (b)
  a "linear noisy valuation" problem where the random valuation is linear plus an
  unknown and assumption-free noise. For the former model, we show a $\Theta(d^{1/3}T^{2/3})$
  minimax regret up to logarithmic factors. For the latter model, we present an algorithm
  that achieves an $O(T^{3/4})$ regret and improve the best-known lower bound from
  $Omega(T^{3/5})$ to $\Omega(T^{2/3})$. These results demonstrate that no-regret
  learning is possible for feature-based dynamic pricing under weak assumptions, but
  also reveal a disappointing fact that the seemingly richer pricing feedback is not
  significantly more useful than the bandit-feedback in regret reduction. '
