title: " Amortized Rejection Sampling in Universal Probabilistic Programming "
abstract: " Naive approaches to amortized inference in probabilistic programs with
  unbounded loops can produce estimators with infinite variance. This is particularly
  true of importance sampling inference in programs that explicitly include rejection
  sampling as part of the user-programmed generative procedure. In this paper we develop
  a new and efficient amortized importance sampling estimator. We prove finite variance
  of our estimator and empirically demonstrate our methodâ€™s correctness and efficiency
  compared to existing alternatives on generative programs containing rejection sampling
  loops and discuss how to implement our method in a generic probabilistic programming
  framework. "
