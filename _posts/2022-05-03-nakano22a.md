title: " Nonparametric Relational Models with Superrectangulation "
abstract: " This paper addresses the question, ”What is the smallest object that contains
  all rectangular partitions with n or fewer blocks?” and shows its application to
  relational data analysis using a new strategy we call super Bayes as an alternative
  to Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) methods. Conventionally, standard BNP methods have
  combined the Aldous-Hoover-Kallenberg representation with parsimonious stochastic
  processes on rectangular partitioning to construct BNP relational models. As a result,
  conventional methods face the great difficulty of searching for a parsimonious random
  rectangular partition that fits the observed data well in Bayesian inference. As
  a way to essentially avoid such a problem, we propose a strategy to combine an extremely
  redundant rectangular partition as a deterministic (non-probabilistic) object. Specifically,
  we introduce a special kind of rectangular partitioning, which we call superrectangulation,
  that contains all possible rectangular partitions. Delightfully, this strategy completely
  eliminates the difficult task of searching around for random rectangular partitions,
  since the superrectangulation is deterministically fixed in inference. Experiments
  on predictive performance in relational data analysis show that the super Bayesian
  model provides a more stable analysis than the existing BNP models, which are less
  likely to be trapped in bad local optima. "
