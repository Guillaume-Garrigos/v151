title: " Adaptive A/B Test on Networks with Cluster Structures "
abstract: " Units in online A/B tests are often involved in social networks. Thus,
  their outcomes may depend on the treatment of their neighbors. Many of such networks
  exhibit certain cluster structures allowing the use of these features in the design
  to reduce the bias from network interference. When the average treatment effect
  (ATE) is considered from the individual perspective, conditions for the valid estimation
  restrict the use of these features in the design. We show that such restrictions
  can be alleviated if the ATE from the cluster perspective is considered. Using an
  illustrative example, we further show that the weights employed by the Horvitz-Thompson
  estimator may not appropriately accommodate the network structure, and purely relying
  on graph-cluster randomization may generate very unbalanced cluster-treated structures
  across the treatment arms. The measures of such structures for one cluster may depend
  on the treatment of other clusters and pose a great challenge for the design of
  A/B tests. To address these issues, we propose a rerandomized-adaptive randomization
  to balance the clusters and a cluster-adjusted estimator to alleviate the problem
  of the weights. Numerical studies are conducted to demonstrate the usage of the
  proposed procedure. "
