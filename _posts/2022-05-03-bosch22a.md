title: " Pick-and-Mix Information Operators for Probabilistic ODE Solvers "
abstract: " Probabilistic numerical solvers for ordinary differential equations compute
  posterior distributions over the solution of an initial value problem via Bayesian
  inference. In this paper, we leverage their probabilistic formulation to seamlessly
  include additional information as general likelihood terms. We show that second-order
  differential equations should be directly provided to the solver, instead of transforming
  the problem to first order. Additionally, by including higher-order information
  or physical conservation laws in the model, solutions become more accurate and more
  physically meaningful. Lastly, we demonstrate the utility of flexible information
  operators by solving differential-algebraic equations. In conclusion, the probabilistic
  formulation of numerical solvers offers a flexible way to incorporate various types
  of information, thus improving the resulting solutions. "
