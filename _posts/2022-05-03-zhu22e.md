title: " Adaptive Private-K-Selection with Adaptive K and Application to Multi-label
  PATE "
abstract: " We provide an end-to-end Renyi DP based-framework for differentially private
  top-$k$ selection. Unlike previous approaches, which require a data-independent
  choice on $k$, we propose to privately release a data-dependent choice of $k$ such
  that the gap between $k$-th and the $(k+1)$st “quality” is large. This is achieved
  by an extension of the Report-Noisy-Max algorithm with a more concentrated Gaussian
  noise. Not only does this eliminates one hyperparameter, the adaptive choice of
  $k$ also certifies the stability of the top-$k$ indices in the unordered set so
  we can release them using a combination of the propose-test-release (PTR) framework
  and the Distance-to-Stability mechanism. We show that our construction improves
  the privacy-utility trade-offs compared to the previous top-$k$ selection algorithms
  theoretically and empirically. Additionally, we apply our algorithm to “Private
  Aggregation of Teacher Ensembles (PATE)” in multi-label classification tasks with
  a large number of labels and show that it leads to significant performance gains. "
