title: " A Random Matrix Perspective on Mixtures of Nonlinearities in High Dimensions "
abstract: " One of the distinguishing characteristics of modern deep learning systems
  is their use of neural network architectures with enormous numbers of parameters,
  often in the millions and sometimes even in the billions. While this paradigm has
  inspired significant research on the properties of large networks, relatively little
  work has been devoted to the fact that these networks are often used to model large
  complex datasets, which may themselves contain millions or even billions of constraints.
  In this work, we focus on this high-dimensional regime in which both the dataset
  size and the number of features tend to infinity. We analyze the performance of
  random feature regression with features $F=f(WX+B)$ for a random weight matrix $W$
  and bias vector $B$, obtaining exact formulae for the asymptotic training and test
  errors for data generated by a linear teacher model. The role of the bias can be
  understood as parameterizing a distribution over activation functions, and our analysis
  directly generalizes to such distributions, even those not expressible with a traditional
  additive bias. Intriguingly, we find that a mixture of nonlinearities can improve
  both the training and test errors over the best single nonlinearity, suggesting
  that mixtures of nonlinearities might be useful for approximate kernel methods or
  neural network architecture design. "
