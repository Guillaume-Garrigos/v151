title: " Denoising and change point localisation in piecewise-constant high-dimensional
  regression coefficients "
abstract: " We study the theoretical properties of the fused lasso procedure originally
  proposed by Tibshirani et al. (2005) in the context of a linear regression model
  in which the regression coefficient are totally ordered and assumed to be sparse
  and piecewise constant. Despite its popularity, to the best of our knowledge, estimation
  error bounds in high-dimensional settings have only been obtained for the simple
  case in which the design matrix is the identity matrix. We formulate a novel restricted
  isometry condition on the design matrix that is tailored to the fused lasso estimator
  and derive estimation bounds for both the constrained version of the fused lasso
  assuming dense coefficients and for its penalised version. We observe that the estimation
  error can be dominated by either the lasso or the fused lasso rate, depending on
  whether the number of non-zero coefficient is larger than the number of piece-wise
  constant segments. Finally, we devise a post-processing procedure to recover the
  piecewise-constant pattern of the coefficients. Extensive numerical experiments
  support our theoretical findings. "
