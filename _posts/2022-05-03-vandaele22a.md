title: " The Curse Revisited: When are Distances Informative for the Ground Truth
  in Noisy High-Dimensional Data? "
abstract: " Distances between data points are widely used in machine learning applications.
  Yet, when corrupted by noise, these distances—and thus the models based upon them—may
  lose their usefulness in high dimensions. Indeed, the small marginal effects of
  the noise may then accumulate quickly, shifting empirical closest and furthest neighbors
  away from the ground truth. In this paper, we exactly characterize such effects
  in noisy high-dimensional data using an asymptotic probabilistic expression. Previously,
  it has been argued that neighborhood queries become meaningless and unstable when
  distance concentration occurs, which means that there is a poor relative discrimination
  between the furthest and closest neighbors in the data. However, we conclude that
  this is not necessarily the case when we decompose the data in a ground truth—which
  we aim to recover—and noise component. More specifically, we derive that under particular
  conditions, empirical neighborhood relations affected by noise are still likely
  to be truthful even when distance concentration occurs. We also include thorough
  empirical verification of our results, as well as interesting experiments in which
  our derived ‘phase shift’ where neighbors become random or not turns out to be identical
  to the phase shift where common dimensionality reduction methods perform poorly
  or well for recovering low-dimensional reconstructions of high-dimensional data
  with dense noise. "
