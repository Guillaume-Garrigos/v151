title: " On Multimarginal Partial Optimal Transport: Equivalent Forms and Computational
  Complexity "
abstract: " We study the multi-marginal partial optimal transport (POT) problem between
  $m$ discrete (unbalanced) measures with at most $n$ supports. We first prove that
  we can obtain two equivalent forms of the multimarginal POT problem in terms of
  the multimarginal optimal transport problem via novel extensions of cost tensors.
  The first equivalent form is derived under the assumptions that the total masses
  of each measure are sufficiently close while the second equivalent form does not
  require any conditions on these masses but at the price of more sophisticated extended
  cost tensor. Our proof techniques for obtaining these equivalent forms rely on novel
  procedures of moving mass in graph theory to push transportation plan into appropriate
  regions. Finally, based on the equivalent forms, we develop an optimization algorithm,
  named the ApproxMPOT algorithm, that builds upon the Sinkhorn algorithm for solving
  the entropic regularized multimarginal optimal transport. We demonstrate that the
  ApproxMPOT algorithm can approximate the optimal value of multimarginal POT problem
  with a computational complexity upper bound of the order $\\bigOtil(m^3(n+1)^{m}/
  \\varepsilon^2)$ where $\\varepsilon > 0$ stands for the desired tolerance. "
