title: " A Contraction Theory Approach to Optimization Algorithms from Acceleration
  Flows "
abstract: " Much recent interest has focused on the design of optimization algorithms
  from the discretization of an associated optimization flow, i.e., a system of differential
  equations (ODEs) whose trajectories solve an associated optimization problem. Such
  a design approach poses an important problem: how to find a principled methodology
  to design and discretize appropriate ODEs. This paper aims to provide a solution
  to this problem through the use of contraction theory. We first introduce general
  mathematical results that explain how contraction theory guarantees the stability
  of the implicit and explicit Euler integration methods. Then, we propose a novel
  system of ODEs, namely the Accelerated-Contracting-Nesterov flow, and use contraction
  theory to establish it is an optimization flow with exponential convergence rate,
  from which the linear convergence rate of its associated optimization algorithm
  is immediately established. Remarkably, a simple explicit Euler discretization of
  this flow corresponds to the Nesterov acceleration method. Finally, we present how
  our approach leads to performance guarantees in the design of optimization algorithms
  for time-varying optimization problems. "
