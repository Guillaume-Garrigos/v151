title: " Learning from an Exploring Demonstrator: Optimal Reward Estimation for Bandits "
abstract: " We introduce the “inverse bandit” problem of estimating the rewards of
  a multi-armed bandit instance from observing the learning process of a low-regret
  demonstrator. Existing approaches to the related problem of inverse reinforcement
  learning assume the execution of an optimal policy, and thereby suffer from an identifiability
  issue. In contrast, we propose to leverage the demonstrator’s behavior en route
  to optimality, and in particular, the exploration phase, for reward estimation.
  We begin by establishing a general information-theoretic lower bound under this
  paradigm that applies to any demonstrator algorithm, which characterizes a fundamental
  tradeoff between reward estimation and the amount of exploration of the demonstrator.
  Then, we develop simple and efficient reward estimators for upper-confidence-based
  demonstrator algorithms that attain the optimal tradeoff, showing in particular
  that consistent reward estimation—free of identifiability issues—is possible under
  our paradigm. Extensive simulations on both synthetic and semi-synthetic data corroborate
  our theoretical results. "
