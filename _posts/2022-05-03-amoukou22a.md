title: " Accurate Shapley Values for explaining tree-based models "
abstract: " Although Shapley Values (SV) are widely used in explainable AI, they can
  be poorly understood and estimated, implying that their analysis may lead to spurious
  inferences and explanations. As a starting point, we remind an invariance principle
  for SV and derive the correct approach for computing the SV of categorical variables
  that are particularly sensitive to the encoding used. In the case of tree-based
  models, we introduce two estimators of Shapley Values that exploit the tree structure
  efficiently and are more accurate than state-of-the-art methods. Simulations and
  comparisons are performed with state-of-the-art algorithms and show the practical
  gain of our approach. Finally, we discuss the ability of SV to provide reliable
  local explanations. We also provide a Python package that compute our estimators
