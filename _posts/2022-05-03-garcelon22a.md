title: " Encrypted Linear Contextual Bandit "
abstract: " Contextual bandit is a general framework for online learning in sequential
  decision-making problems that has found application in a wide range of domains,
  including recommendation systems, online advertising, and clinical trials. A critical
  aspect of bandit methods is that they require to observe the contexts –i.e., individual
  or group-level data– and rewards in order to solve the sequential problem. The large
  deployment in industrial applications has increased interest in methods that preserve
  the users’ privacy. In this paper, we introduce a privacy-preserving bandit framework
  based on homomorphic encryption which allows computations using encrypted data.
  The algorithm only observes encrypted information (contexts and rewards) and has
  no ability to decrypt it. Leveraging the properties of homomorphic encryption, we
  show that despite the complexity of the setting, it is possible to solve linear
  contextual bandits over encrypted data with a $\\widetilde{O}(d\\sqrt{T})$ regret
  bound in any linear contextual bandit problem, while keeping data encrypted. "
