title: " Near-optimal Local Convergence of Alternating Gradient Descent-Ascent for
  Minimax Optimization "
abstract: " Smooth minimax games often proceed by simultaneous or alternating gradient
  updates. Although algorithms with alternating updates are commonly used in practice,
  the majority of existing theoretical analyses focus on simultaneous algorithms for
  convenience of analysis. In this paper, we study alternating gradient descent-ascent (Alt-GDA)
  in minimax games and show that Alt-GDA is superior to its simultaneous counterpart (Sim-GDA)
  in many settings. We prove that Alt-GDA achieves a near-optimal local convergence
  rate for strongly convex-strongly concave (SCSC) problems while Sim-GDA converges
  at a much slower rate. To our knowledge, this is the first result of any setting
  showing that Alt-GDA converges faster than Sim-GDA by more than a constant. We further
  adapt the theory of integral quadratic constraints (IQC) and show that Alt-GDA attains
  the same rate globally for a subclass of SCSC minimax problems. Empirically, we
  demonstrate that alternating updates speed up GAN training significantly and the
  use of optimism only helps for simultaneous algorithms. "
