title: " Online Competitive Influence Maximization "
abstract: " Online influence maximization has attracted much attention as a way to
  maximize influence spread through a social network while learning the values of
  unknown network parameters. Most previous works focus on single-item diffusion.
  In this paper, we introduce a new Online Competitive Influence Maximization (OCIM)
  problem, where two competing items (e.g., products, news stories) propagate in the
  same network and influence probabilities on edges are unknown. We adopt a combinatorial
  multi-armed bandit (CMAB) framework for OCIM, but unlike the non-competitive setting,
  the important monotonicity property (influence spread increases when influence probabilities
  on edges increase) no longer holds due to the competitive nature of propagation,
  which brings a significant new challenge to the problem. We provide a nontrivial
  proof showing that the Triggering Probability Modulated (TPM) condition for CMAB
  still holds in OCIM, which is instrumental for our proposed algorithms OCIM-TS and
  OCIM-OFU to achieve sublinear Bayesian and frequentist regret, respectively. We
  also design an OCIM-ETC algorithm that requires less feedback and easier offline
  computation, at the expense of a worse frequentist regret bound. Experimental evaluations
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms. "
