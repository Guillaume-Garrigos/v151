title: " Optimal Compression of Locally Differentially Private Mechanisms "
abstract: " Compressing the output of $\\epsilon$-locally differentially private (LDP)
  randomizers naively leads to suboptimal utility. In this work, we demonstrate the
  benefits of using schemes that jointly compress and privatize the data using shared
  randomness. In particular, we investigate a family of schemes based on Minimal Random
  Coding (Havasi et al., 2019) and prove that they offer optimal privacy-accuracy-communication
  tradeoffs. Our theoretical and empirical findings show that our approach can compress
  PrivUnit (Bhowmick et al., 2018) and Subset Selection (Ye et al., 2018), the best
  known LDP algorithms for mean and frequency estimation, to the order of $\\epsilon$
  bits of communication while preserving their privacy and accuracy guarantees. "
