title: " Optimal partition recovery in general graphs "
abstract: " We consider a graph-structured change point problem in which we observe
  a random vector with piece-wise constant but otherwise unknown mean and whose independent,
  sub-Gaussian coordinates correspond to the $n$ nodes of a fixed graph. We are interested
  in the localisation task of recovering the partition of the nodes associated to
  the constancy regions of the mean vector or, equivalently, of estimating the cut
  separating the sub-graphs over which the mean remains constant. Although graph-valued
  signals of this type have been previously studied in the literature for the different
  tasks of testing for the presence of an anomalous cluster and of estimating the
  mean vector, no localisation results are known outside the classical case of chain
  graphs. When the partition $\\mathcal{S}$ consists of only two elements, we characterise
  the difficulty of the localisation problem in terms of four key parameters: the
  maximal noise variance $\\sigma^2$, the size $\\Delta$ of the smaller element of
  the partition, the magnitude $\\kappa$ of the difference in the signal values across
  contiguous elements of the partition and the sum of the effective resistance edge
  weights $|\\partial_r(\\mathcal{S})|$ of the corresponding cut – a graph theoretic
  quantity quantifying the size of the partition boundary. In particular, we demonstrate
  an information theoretical lower bound implying that, in the low signal-to-noise
  ratio regime $\\kappa^2 \\Delta \\sigma^{-2} |\\partial_r(\\mathcal{S})|^{-1} \\lesssim
  1$, no consistent estimator of the true partition exists. On the other hand, when
  $\\kappa^2 \\Delta \\sigma^{-2} |\\partial_r(\\mathcal{S})|^{-1} \\gtrsim \\zeta_n
  \\log\\{r(|E|)\\}$, with $r(|E|)$ being the sum of effective resistance weighted
  edges and $\\zeta_n$ being any diverging sequence in $n$, we show that a polynomial-time,
  approximate $\\ell_0$-penalised least squared estimator delivers a localisation
  error – measured by the symmetric difference between the true and estimated partition
  – of order $ \\kappa^{-2} \\sigma^2 |\\partial_r(\\mathcal{S})| \\log\\{r(|E|)\\}$.
  Aside from the $\\log\\{r(|E|)\\}$ term, this rate is minimax optimal. Finally,
  we provide discussions on the localisation error for more general partitions of
  unknown sizes. "
