title: " Adversarial Tracking Control via Strongly Adaptive Online Learning with Memory "
abstract: " We consider the problem of tracking an adversarial state sequence in a
  linear dynamical system subject to adversarial disturbances and loss functions,
  generalizing earlier settings in the literature. To this end, we develop three techniques,
  each of independent interest. First, we propose a comparator-adaptive algorithm
  for online linear optimization with movement cost. Without tuning, it nearly matches
  the performance of the optimally tuned gradient descent in hindsight. Next, considering
  a related problem called online learning with memory, we construct a novel strongly
  adaptive algorithm that uses our first contribution as a building block. Finally,
  we present the first reduction from adversarial tracking control to strongly adaptive
  online learning with memory. Summarizing these individual techniques, we obtain
  an adversarial tracking controller with a strong performance guarantee even when
  the reference trajectory has a large range of movement. "
