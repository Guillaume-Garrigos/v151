title: " Jointly Efficient and Optimal Algorithms for Logistic Bandits "
abstract: " Logistic Bandits have recently undergone careful scrutiny by virtue of
  their combined theoretical and practical relevance. This research effort delivered
  statistically efficient algorithms, improving the regret of previous strategies
  by exponentially large factors. Such algorithms are however strikingly costly as
  they require $\\Omega(t)$ operations at each round. On the other hand, a different
  line of research focused on computational efficiency ($\\mathcal{O}(1)$ per-round
  cost), but at the cost of letting go of the aforementioned exponential improvements.
  Obtaining the best of both world is unfortunately not a matter of marrying both
  approaches. Instead we introduce a new learning procedure for Logistic Bandits.
  It yields confidence sets which sufficient statistics can be easily maintained online
  without sacrificing statistical tightness. Combined with efficient planning mechanisms
  we design fast algorithms which regret performance still match the problem-dependent
  lower-bound of Abeille et al (2021). To the best of our knowledge, those are the
  first Logistic Bandit algorithms that simultaneously enjoy statistical and computational
  efficiency. "
