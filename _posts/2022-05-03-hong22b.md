title: " Thompson Sampling with a Mixture Prior "
abstract: " We study Thompson sampling (TS) in online decision making, where the uncertain
  environment is sampled from a mixture distribution. This is relevant in multi-task
  learning, where a learning agent faces different classes of problems. We incorporate
  this structure in a natural way by initializing TS with a mixture prior, and call
  the resulting algorithm MixTS. To analyze MixTS, we develop a novel and general
  proof technique for analyzing the concentration of mixture distributions. We use
  it to derive Bayes regret bounds for MixTS in both linear bandits and finite-horizon
  reinforcement learning (RL). Our regret bounds reflect the structure of the mixture
  prior, and depend on the number of mixture components and their width. We demonstrate
  the empirical effectiveness of MixTS in synthetic and real-world experiments. "
