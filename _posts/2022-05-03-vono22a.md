title: " QLSD: Quantised Langevin Stochastic Dynamics for Bayesian Federated Learning "
abstract: " The objective of Federated Learning (FL) is to perform statistical inference
  for data which are decentralised and stored locally on networked clients. FL raises
  many constraints which include privacy and data ownership, communication overhead,
  statistical heterogeneity, and partial client participation. In this paper, we address
  these problems in the framework of the Bayesian paradigm. To this end, we propose
  a novel federated Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm, referred to as Quantised Langevin
  Stochastic Dynamics which may be seen as an extension to the FL setting of Stochastic
  Gradient Langevin Dynamics, which handles the communication bottleneck using gradient
  compression. To improve performance, we then introduce variance reduction techniques,
  which lead to two improved versions coined QLSD$^\\star$ and QLSD$^{++}$. We give
  both non-asymptotic and asymptotic convergence guarantees for the proposed algorithms.
  We illustrate their performances using various Bayesian Federated Learning benchmarks. "
