title: " Momentum Accelerates the Convergence of Stochastic AUPRC Maximization "
abstract: " In this paper, we study stochastic optimization of areas under precision-recall
  curves (AUPRC), which is widely used for combating imbalanced classification tasks.
  Although a few methods have been proposed for maximizing AUPRC, stochastic optimization
  of AUPRC with convergence guarantee remains an undeveloped territory. A state-of-the-art
  complexity is $O(1/\\epsilon^5)$ for finding an $\\epsilon$-stationary solution.
  In this paper, we further improve the stochastic optimization of AURPC by (i) developing
  novel stochastic momentum methods with a better iteration complexity of $O(1/\\epsilon^4)$
  for finding an $\\epsilon$-stationary solution; and (ii) designing a novel family
  of stochastic adaptive methods with the same iteration complexity, which enjoy faster
  convergence in practice. To this end, we propose two innovative techniques that
  are critical for improving the convergence: (i) the biased estimators for tracking
  individual ranking scores are updated in a randomized coordinate-wise manner; and
  (ii) a momentum update is used on top of the stochastic gradient estimator for tracking
  the gradient of the objective. The novel analysis of Adam-style updates is also
  one main contribution. Extensive experiments on various data sets demonstrate the
  effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Of independent interest, the proposed
  stochastic momentum and adaptive algorithms are also applicable to a class of two-level
  stochastic dependent compositional optimization problems. "
