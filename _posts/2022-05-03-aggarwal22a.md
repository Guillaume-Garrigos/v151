title: " Reconstructing Test Labels from Noisy Loss Functions "
abstract: " Machine learning classifiers rely on loss functions for performance evaluation,
  often on a private (hidden) dataset. In a recent line of research, label inference
  was introduced as the problem of reconstructing the ground truth labels of this
  private dataset from just the (possibly perturbed) cross-entropy loss function values
  evaluated at chosen prediction vectors (without any other access to the hidden dataset).
  In this paper, we formally study the necessary and sufficient conditions under which
  label inference is possible from any (noisy) loss function value. Using tools from
  analytical number theory, we show that a broad class of commonly used loss functions,
  including general Bregman divergence-based losses and multiclass cross-entropy with
  common activation functions like sigmoid and softmax, it is possible to design label
  inference attacks that succeed even for arbitrary noise levels and using only a
  single query from the adversary. We formally study the computational complexity
  of label inference and show that while in general, designing adversarial prediction
  vectors for these attacks is co-NP-hard, once we have these vectors, the attacks
  can also be carried out through a lightweight augmentation to any neural network
  model, making them look benign and hard to detect. The observations in this paper
  provide a deeper understanding of the vulnerabilities inherent in modern machine
  learning and could be used for designing future trustworthy ML. "
