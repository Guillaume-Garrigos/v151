title: " Learning Quantile Functions without Quantile Crossing for Distribution-free
  Time Series Forecasting "
abstract: " Quantile regression is an effective technique to quantify uncertainty,
  fit challenging underlying distributions, and often provide full probabilistic predictions
  through joint learnings over multiple quantile levels. A common drawback of these
  joint quantile regressions, however, is quantile crossing, which violates the desirable
  monotone property of the conditional quantile function. In this work, we propose
  the Incremental (Spline) Quantile Functions I(S)QF, a flexible and efficient distribution-free
  quantile estimation framework that resolves quantile crossing with a simple neural
  network layer. Moreover, I(S)QF inter/extrapolate to predict arbitrary quantile
  levels that differ from the underlying training ones. Equipped with the analytical
  evaluation of the continuous ranked probability score of I(S)QF representations,
  we apply our methods to NN-based times series forecasting cases, where the savings
  of the expensive re-training costs for non-trained quantile levels is particularly
  significant. We also provide a generalization error analysis of our proposed approaches
  under the sequence-to-sequence setting. Lastly, extensive experiments demonstrate
  the improvement of consistency and accuracy errors over other baselines. "
