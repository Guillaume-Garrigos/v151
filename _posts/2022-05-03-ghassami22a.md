title: " Minimax Kernel Machine Learning for a Class of Doubly Robust Functionals
  with Application to Proximal Causal Inference "
abstract: " Robins et al. (2008) introduced a class of influence functions (IFs) which
  could be used to obtain doubly robust moment functions for the corresponding parameters.
  However, that class does not include the IF of parameters for which the nuisance
  functions are solutions to integral equations. Such parameters are particularly
  important in the field of causal inference, specifically in the recently proposed
  proximal causal inference framework of Tchetgen Tchetgen et al. (2020), which allows
  for estimating the causal effect in the presence of latent confounders. In this
  paper, we first extend the class of Robins et al. to include doubly robust IFs in
  which the nuisance functions are solutions to integral equations. Then we demonstrate
  that the double robustness property of these IFs can be leveraged to construct estimating
  equations for the nuisance functions, which enables us to solve the integral equations
  without resorting to parametric models. We frame the estimation of the nuisance
  functions as a minimax optimization problem. We provide convergence rates for the
  nuisance functions and conditions required for asymptotic linearity of the estimator
  of the parameter of interest. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed
  methodology leads to robust and high-performance estimators for average causal effect
  in the proximal causal inference framework. "
