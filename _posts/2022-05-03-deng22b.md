title: " Weighted Gaussian Process Bandits for Non-stationary Environments "
abstract: " In this paper, we consider the Gaussian process (GP) bandit optimization
  problem in a non-stationary environment. To capture external changes, the black-box
  function is allowed to be time-varying within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space
  (RKHS). To this end, we develop WGP-UCB, a novel UCB-type algorithm based on weighted
  Gaussian process regression. A key challenge is how to cope with infinite-dimensional
  feature maps. To that end, we leverage kernel approximation techniques to prove
  a sublinear regret bound, which is the first (frequentist) sublinear regret guarantee
  on weighted time-varying bandits with general nonlinear rewards. This result generalizes
  both non-stationary linear bandits and standard GP-UCB algorithms. Further, a novel
  concentration inequality is achieved for weighted Gaussian process regression with
  general weights. We also provide universal upper bounds and weight-dependent upper
  bounds for weighted maximum information gains. These results are of independent
  interest for applications such as news ranking and adaptive pricing, where weights
  can be adopted to capture the importance or quality of data. Finally, we conduct
  experiments to highlight the favorable gains of the proposed algorithm in many cases
  when compared to existing methods. "
