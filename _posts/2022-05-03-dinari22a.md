title: " Sampling in Dirichlet Process Mixture Models for Clustering Streaming Data "
abstract: " Practical tools for clustering streaming data must be fast enough to handle
  the arrival rate of the observations. Typically, they also must adapt on the fly
  to possible lack of stationarity; i.e., the data statistics may be time-dependent
  due to various forms of drifts, changes in the number of clusters, etc. The Dirichlet
  Process Mixture Model (DPMM), whose Bayesian nonparametric nature allows it to adapt
  its complexity to the data, seems a natural choice for the streaming-data case.
  In its classical formulation, however, the DPMM cannot capture common types of drifts
  in the data statistics. Moreover, and regardless of that limitation, existing methods
  for online DPMM inference are too slow to handle rapid data streams. In this work
  we propose adapting both the DPMM and a known DPMM sampling-based non-streaming
  inference method for streaming-data clustering. We demonstrate the utility of the
  proposed method on several challenging settings, where it obtains state-of-the-art
  results while being on par with other methods in terms of speed. "
