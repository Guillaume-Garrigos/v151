title: " Learning Quantile Functions for Temporal Point Processes with Recurrent Neural
  Splines "
abstract: " We can build flexible predictive models for rich continuous-time event
  data by combining the framework of temporal point processes (TPP) with (recurrent)
  neural networks. We propose a new neural parametrization for TPPs based on the conditional
  quantile function. Specifically, we use a flexible monotonic rational-quadratic
  spline to learn a smooth continuous quantile function. Conditioning on historical
  events is achieved through a recurrent neural network. This novel parametrization
  provides a flexible yet tractable TPP model with multiple advantages, such as analytical
  sampling and closed-form expressions for quantiles and prediction intervals. While
  neural TPP models are often trained using maximum likelihood estimation, we consider
  the more robust continuous ranked probability score (CRPS). We additionally derive
  a closed-form expression for the CRPS of our model. Finally, we demonstrate that
  the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in standard prediction
  tasks on both synthetic and real-world event data. "
