title: " Fast Fourier Transform Reductions for Bayesian Network Inference "
abstract: " Bayesian Networks are useful for analyzing the properties of systems with
  large populations of interacting agents (e.g., in social modeling applications and
  distributed service applications). These networks typically have large functions
  (CPTs), making exact inference intractable. However, often these models have additive
  symmetry. In this paper we show how summation-based CPTs, especially in the presence
  of symmetry, can be computed efficiently through the usage of the Fast Fourier Transform
  (FFT). In particular, we propose an efficient method using the FFT for reducing
  the size of Conditional Probability Tables (CPTs) in Bayesian Networks with summation-based
  causal independence (CI). We then show how to apply this reduction directly towards
  the acceleration of Bucket Elimination, and we subsequently provide experimental
  results demonstrating the computational speedup provided by our method. "
