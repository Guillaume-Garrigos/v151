title: " Data-splitting improves statistical performance in overparameterized regimes "
abstract: " While large training datasets generally offer improvement in model performance,
  the training process becomes computationally expensive and time consuming. Distributed
  learning is a common strategy to reduce the overall training time by exploiting
  multiple computing devices. Recently, it has been observed in the single machine
  setting that overparameterization is essential for benign overfitting in ridgeless
  regression in Hilbert spaces. We show that in this regime, data splitting has a
  regularizing effect, hence improving statistical performance and computational complexity
  at the same time. We further provide a unified framework that allows to analyze
  both the finite and infinite dimensional setting. We numerically demonstrate the
  effect of different model parameters. "
