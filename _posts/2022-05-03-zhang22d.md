title: " Cycle Consistent Probability Divergences Across Different Spaces "
abstract: " Discrepancy measures between probability distributions are at the core
  of statistical inference and machine learning. In many applications, distributions
  of interest are supported on different spaces, and yet a meaningful correspondence
  between data points is desired. Motivated to explicitly encode consistent bidirectional
  maps into the discrepancy measure, this work proposes a novel unbalanced Monge optimal
  transport formulation for matching, up to isometries, distributions on different
  spaces. Our formulation arises as a principled relaxation of the Gromov-Haussdroff
  distance between metric spaces, and employs two cycle-consistent maps that push
  forward each distribution onto the other. We study structural properties of the
  proposed discrepancy and, in particular, show that it captures the popular cycle-consistent
  generative adversarial network (GAN) framework as a special case, thereby providing
  the theory to explain it. Motivated by computational efficiency, we then kernelize
  the discrepancy and restrict the mappings to parametric function classes. The resulting
  kernelized version is coined the generalized maximum mean discrepancy (GMMD). Convergence
  rates for empirical estimation of GMMD are studied and experiments to support our
  theory are provided. "
