title: " Spectral risk-based learning using unbounded losses "
abstract: ' In this work, we consider the setting of learning problems under a wide
  class of spectral risk (or "L-risk") functions, where a Lipschitz-continuous spectral
  density is used to flexibly assign weight to extreme loss values. We obtain excess
  risk guarantees for a derivative-free learning procedure under unbounded heavy-tailed
  loss distributions, and propose a computationally efficient implementation which
  empirically outperforms traditional risk minimizers in terms of balancing spectral
  risk and misclassification error. '
