title: " Differentially Private Histograms under Continual Observation: Streaming
  Selection into the Unknown "
abstract: " We generalize the continuous observation privacy setting from Dwork et
  al. and Chan et al. by allowing each event in a stream to be a subset of some (possibly
  unknown) universe of items. We design differentially private (DP) algorithms for
  histograms in several settings, including top-k selection, with privacy loss that
  scales with polylog(T), where T is the maximum length of the input stream. We present
  a meta-algorithm that can use existing one-shot top-k private algorithms as a subroutine
  to continuously release DP histograms from a stream. Further, we present more practical
  DP algorithms for two settings: 1) continuously releasing the top-k counts from
  a histogram over a known domain when an event can consist of an arbitrary number
  of items, and 2) continuously releasing histograms over an unknown domain when an
  event has a limited number of items. "
