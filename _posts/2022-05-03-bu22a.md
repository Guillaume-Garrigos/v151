title: " Characterizing and Understanding the Generalization Error of Transfer Learning
  with Gibbs Algorithm "
abstract: " We provide an information-theoretic analysis of the generalization ability
  of Gibbs-based transfer learning algorithms by focusing on two popular empirical
  risk minimization (ERM) approaches for transfer learning, $\\alpha$-weighted-ERM
  and two-stage-ERM. Our key result is an exact characterization of the generalization
  behavior using the conditional symmetrized Kullback-Leibler (KL) information between
  the output hypothesis and the target training samples given the source training
  samples. Our results can also be applied to provide novel distribution-free generalization
  error upper bounds on these two aforementioned Gibbs algorithms. Our approach is
  versatile, as it also characterizes the generalization errors and excess risks of
  these two Gibbs algorithms in the asymptotic regime, where they converge to the
  $\\alpha$-weighted-ERM and two-stage-ERM, respectively. Based on our theoretical
  results, we show that the benefits of transfer learning can be viewed as a bias-variance
  trade-off, with the bias induced by the source distribution and the variance induced
  by the lack of target samples. We believe this viewpoint can guide the choice of
  transfer learning algorithms in practice. "
