title: " Effective Nonlinear Feature Selection Method based on HSIC Lasso and with
  Variational Inference "
abstract: " HSIC Lasso is one of the most effective sparse nonlinear feature selection
  methods based on the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion. We propose an adaptive
  nonlinear feature selection method, which is based on the HSIC Lasso, that uses
  a stochastic model with a family of super-Gaussian prior distributions for sparsity
  enhancement. The method includes easily implementable closed-form update equations
  that are derived approximately from variational inference and can handle high-dimensional
  and large datasets. We applied the method to several synthetic datasets and real-world
  datasets and verified its effectiveness regarding redundancy, computational complexity,
  and classification and prediction accuracy using the selected features. The results
  indicate that the method can more effectively remove irrelevant features, leaving
  only relevant features. In certain problem settings, the method assigned non-zero
  importance only to the actually relevant features. This is an important characteristic
  for practical use. "
