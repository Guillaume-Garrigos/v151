title: " On the Convergence of Stochastic Extragradient for Bilinear Games using Restarted
  Iteration Averaging "
abstract: " We study the stochastic bilinear minimax optimization problem, presenting
  an analysis of the same-sample Stochastic ExtraGradient (SEG) method with constant
  step size, and presenting variations of the method that yield favorable convergence.
  In sharp contrasts with the basic SEG method whose last iterate only contracts to
  a fixed neighborhood of the Nash equilibrium, SEG augmented with iteration averaging
  provably converges to the Nash equilibrium under the same standard settings, and
  such a rate is further improved by incorporating a scheduled restarting procedure.
  In the interpolation setting where noise vanishes at the Nash equilibrium, we achieve
  an optimal convergence rate up to tight constants. We present numerical experiments
  that validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the effectiveness of the
  SEG method when equipped with iteration averaging and restarting. "
