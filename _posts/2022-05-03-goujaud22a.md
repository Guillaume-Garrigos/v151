title: " Super-Acceleration with Cyclical Step-sizes "
abstract: " We develop a convergence-rate analysis of momentum with cyclical step-sizes.
  We show that under some assumption on the spectral gap of Hessians in machine learning,
  cyclical step-sizes are provably faster than constant step-sizes. More precisely,
  we develop a convergence rate analysis for quadratic objectives that provides optimal
  parameters and shows that cyclical learning rates can improve upon traditional lower
  complexity bounds. We further propose a systematic approach to design optimal first
  order methods for quadratic minimization with a given spectral structure. Finally,
  we provide a local convergence rate analysis beyond quadratic minimization for the
  proposed methods and illustrate our findings through benchmarks on least squares
  and logistic regression problems. "
