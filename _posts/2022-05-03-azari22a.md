title: " Equivariant Deep Dynamical Model for Motion Prediction "
abstract: " Learning representations through deep generative modeling is a powerful
  approach for dynamical modeling to discover the most simplified and compressed underlying
  description of the data, to then use it for other tasks such as prediction. Most
  learning tasks have intrinsic symmetries, i.e., the input transformations leave
  the output unchanged, or the output undergoes a similar transformation. The learning
  process is, however, usually uninformed of these symmetries. Therefore, the learned
  representations for individually transformed inputs may not be meaningfully related.
  In this paper, we propose an SO(3) equivariant deep dynamical model (EqDDM) for
  motion prediction that learns a structured representation of the input space in
  the sense that the embedding varies with symmetry transformations. EqDDM is equipped
  with equivariant networks to parameterize the state-space emission and transition
  models. We demonstrate the superior predictive performance of the proposed model
  on various motion data. "
