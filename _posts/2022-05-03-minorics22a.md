title: " Testing Granger Non-Causality in Panels with Cross-Sectional Dependencies "
abstract: " This paper proposes a new approach for testing Granger non-causality on
  panel data. Instead of aggregating panel member statistics, we aggregate their corresponding
  p-values and show that the resulting p-value approximately bounds the type I error
  by the chosen significance level even if the panel members are dependent. We compare
  our approach against the most widely used Granger causality algorithm on panel data
  and show that our approach yields lower FDR at the same power for large sample sizes
  and panels with cross sectional dependencies. Finally, we examine COVID-19 data
  about confirmed cases and deaths measured in countries/regions worldwide and show
  that our approach is able to discover the true causal relation between confirmed
  cases and deaths while state-of-the-art approaches fail. "
