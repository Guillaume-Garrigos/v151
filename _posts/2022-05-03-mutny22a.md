title: " Sensing Cox Processes via Posterior Sampling and Positive Bases "
abstract: " We study adaptive sensing of Cox point processes, a widely used model
  from spatial statistics. We introduce three tasks: maximization of captured events,
  search for the maximum of the intensity function and learning level sets of the
  intensity function. We model the intensity function as a sample from a truncated
  Gaussian process, represented in a specially constructed positive basis. In this
  basis, the positivity constraint on the intensity function has a simple form. We
  show how the <em>minimal description positive basis</em> can be adapted to the covariance
  kernel, to non-stationarity and make connections to common positive bases from prior
  works. Our adaptive sensing algorithms use Langevin dynamics and are based on posterior
  sampling (<em>Cox-Thompson</em>) and top-two posterior sampling (<em>Top2</em>)
  principles. With latter, the difference between samples serves as a surrogate to
  the uncertainty. We demonstrate the approach using examples from environmental monitoring
  and crime rate modeling, and compare it to the classical Bayesian experimental design
  approach. "
