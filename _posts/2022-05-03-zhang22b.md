title: " Identifiable Energy-based Representations: An Application to Estimating Heterogeneous
  Causal Effects "
abstract: " Conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) allow us to understand the
  effect heterogeneity across a large population of individuals. However, typical
  CATE learners assume all confounding variables are measured in order for the CATE
  to be identifiable. This requirement can be satisfied by collecting many variables,
  at the expense of increased sample complexity for estimating CATEs. To combat this,
  we propose an energy-based model (EBM) that learns a low-dimensional representation
  of the variables by employing a noise contrastive loss function. With our EBM we
  introduce a preprocessing step that alleviates the dimensionality curse for any
  existing learner developed for estimating CATEs. We prove that our EBM keeps the
  representations partially identifiable up to some universal constant, as well as
  having universal approximation capability. These properties enable the representations
  to converge and keep the CATE estimates consistent. Experiments demonstrate the
  convergence of the representations, as well as show that estimating CATEs on our
  representations performs better than on the variables or the representations obtained
  through other dimensionality reduction methods. "
