title: " Differentially Private Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Data "
abstract: " Federated Learning (FL) is a paradigm for large-scale distributed learning
  which faces two key challenges: (i) training efficiently from highly heterogeneous
  user data, and (ii) protecting the privacy of participating users. In this work,
  we propose a novel FL approach (DP-SCAFFOLD) to tackle these two challenges together
  by incorporating Differential Privacy (DP) constraints into the popular SCAFFOLD
  algorithm. We focus on the challenging setting where users communicate with a “honest-but-curious”
  server without any trusted intermediary, which requires to ensure privacy not only
  towards a third party observing the final model but also towards the server itself.
  Using advanced results from DP theory, we establish the convergence of our algorithm
  for convex and non-convex objectives. Our paper clearly highlights the trade-off
  between utility and privacy and demonstrates the superiority of DP-SCAFFOLD over
  the state-of-the-art algorithm DP-FedAvg when the number of local updates and the
  level of heterogeneity grows. Our numerical results confirm our analysis and show
  that DP-SCAFFOLD provides significant gains in practice. "
