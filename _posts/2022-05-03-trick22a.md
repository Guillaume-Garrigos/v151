title: " Bayesian Classifier Fusion with an Explicit Model of Correlation "
abstract: " Combining the outputs of multiple classifiers or experts into a single
  probabilistic classification is a fundamental task in machine learning with broad
  applications from classifier fusion to expert opinion pooling. Here we present a
  hierarchical Bayesian model of probabilistic classifier fusion based on a new correlated
  Dirichlet distribution. This distribution explicitly models positive correlations
  between marginally Dirichlet-distributed random vectors thereby allowing explicit
  modeling of correlations between base classifiers or experts. The proposed model
  naturally accommodates the classic Independent Opinion Pool and other independent
  fusion algorithms as special cases. It is evaluated by uncertainty reduction and
  correctness of fusion on synthetic and real-world data sets. We show that a change
  in performance of the fused classifier due to uncertainty reduction can be Bayes
  optimal even for highly correlated base classifiers. "
