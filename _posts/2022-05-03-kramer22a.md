title: " Probabilistic Numerical Method of Lines for Time-Dependent Partial Differential
  Equations "
abstract: " This work develops a class of probabilistic algorithms for the numerical
  solution of nonlinear, time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). Current
  state-of-the-art PDE solvers treat the space- and time-dimensions separately, serially,
  and with black-box algorithms, which obscures the interactions between spatial and
  temporal approximation errors and misguides the quantification of the overall error.
  To fix this issue, we introduce a probabilistic version of a technique called method
  of lines. The proposed algorithm begins with a Gaussian process interpretation of
  finite difference methods, which then interacts naturally with filtering-based probabilistic
  ordinary differential equation (ODE) solvers because they share a common language:
  Bayesian inference. Joint quantification of space- and time-uncertainty becomes
  possible without losing the performance benefits of well-tuned ODE solvers. Thereby,
  we extend the toolbox of probabilistic programs for differential equation simulation
  to PDEs. "
