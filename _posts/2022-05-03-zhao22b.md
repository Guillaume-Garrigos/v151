title: " Provably Efficient Policy Optimization for Two-Player Zero-Sum Markov Games "
abstract: " Policy-based methods with function approximation are widely used for solving
  two-player zero-sum games with large state and/or action spaces. However, it remains
  elusive how to obtain optimization and statistical guarantees for such algorithms.
  We present a new policy optimization algorithm with function approximation and prove
  that under standard regularity conditions on the Markov game and the function approximation
  class, our algorithm finds a near-optimal policy within a polynomial number of samples
  and iterations. To our knowledge, this is the first provably efficient policy optimization
  algorithm with function approximation that solves two-player zero-sum Markov games. "
