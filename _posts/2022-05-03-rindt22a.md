title: " Survival regression with proper scoring rules and monotonic neural networks "
abstract: " We consider frequently used scoring rules for right-censored survival
  regression models such as time-dependent concordance, survival-CRPS, integrated
  Brier score and integrated binomial log-likelihood, and prove that neither of them
  is a proper scoring rule. This means that the true survival distribution may be
  scored worse than incorrect distributions, leading to inaccurate estimation. We
  prove, in contrast to these scores, that the right-censored log-likelihood is a
  proper scoring rule, i.e. the highest expected score is achieved by the true distribution.
  Despite this, modern feed-forward neural-network-based survival regression models
  are unable to train and validate directly on right-censored log-likelihood, due
  to its intractability, and resort to the aforementioned alternatives, i.e. non-proper
  scoring rules. We therefore propose a simple novel survival regression method capable
  of directly optimizing log-likelihood using a monotonic restriction on the time-dependent
  weights, coined SurvivalMonotonic-net (SuMo-net). SuMo-net achieves state-of-the-art
  log-likelihood scores across several datasets with 20â€“100x computational speedup
  on inference over existing state-of-the-art neural methods and is readily applicable
  to datasets with several million observations. "
