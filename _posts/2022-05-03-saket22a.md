title: " On Combining Bags to Better Learn from Label Proportions "
abstract: " In the framework of learning from label proportions (LLP) the goal is
  to learn a good instance-level label predictor from the observed label proportions
  of bags of instances. Most of the LLP algorithms either explicitly or implicitly
  assume the nature of bag distributions with respect to the actual labels and instances,
  or cleverly adapt supervised learning techniques to suit LLP. In practical applications
  however, the scale and nature of data could render such assumptions invalid and
  the many of the algorithms impractical. In this paper we address the hard problem
  of solving LLP with provable error bounds while being bag distribution agnostic
  and model agnostic. We first propose the concept of generalized bags, an extension
  of bags and then devise an algorithm to combine bag distributions, if possible,
  into good generalized bag distributions. We show that (w.h.p) any classifier optimizing
  the squared Euclidean label-proportion loss on such a generalized bag distribution
  is guaranteed to minimize the instance-level loss as well. The predictive quality
  of our method is experimentally evaluated and it equals or betters the previous
  methods on pseudo-synthetic and real-world datasets. "
