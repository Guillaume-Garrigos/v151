title: " Federated Functional Gradient Boosting "
abstract: " Motivated by the tremendous success of boosting methods in the standard
  centralized model of learning, we initiate the theory of boosting in the Federated
  Learning setting. The primary challenges in the Federated Learning setting are heterogeneity
  in client data and the requirement that no client data can be transmitted to the
  server. We develop federated functional gradient boosting (FFGB) an algorithm that
  is designed to handle these challenges. Under appropriate assumptions on the weak
  learning oracle, the FFGB algorithm is proved to efficiently converge to certain
  neighborhoods of the global optimum. The radii of these neighborhoods depend upon
  the level of heterogeneity measured via the total variation distance and the much
  tighter Wasserstein-1 distance, and diminish to zero as the setting becomes more
  homogeneous. In practice, as suggested by our theoretical findings, we propose using
  FFGB to warm-start existing Federated Learning solvers and observe significant performance
  boost in highly heterogeneous settings. The code can be found here. "
