title: " Transductive Robust Learning Guarantees "
abstract: " We study the problem of adversarially robust learning in the transductive
  setting. For classes H of bounded VC dimension, we propose a simple transductive
  learner that when presented with a set of labeled training examples and a set of
  unlabeled test examples (both sets possibly adversarially perturbed), it correctly
  labels the test examples with a robust error rate that is linear in the VC dimension
  and is adaptive to the complexity of the perturbation set. This result provides
  an exponential improvement in dependence on VC dimension over the best known upper
  bound on the robust error in the inductive setting, at the expense of competing
  with a more restrictive notion of optimal robust error. "
