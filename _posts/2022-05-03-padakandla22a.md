title: " PAC Learning of Quantum Measurement Classes : Sample Complexity Bounds and
  Universal Consistency "
abstract: " We formulate a quantum analogue of the fundamental classical PAC learning
  problem. As on a quantum computer, we model data to be encoded by modifying specific
  attributes - spin axis of an electron, plane of polarization of a photon - of sub-atomic
  particles. Any interaction, including reading off, extracting or learning from such
  data is via quantum measurements, thus leading us to a problem of PAC learning Quantum
  Measurement Classes. We propose and analyze the sample complexity of a new ERM algorithm
  that respects quantum non-commutativity. Our study entails that we define the VC
  dimension of Positive Operator Valued Measure(ments) (POVMs) concept classes. Our
  sample complexity bounds involve optimizing over partitions of jointly measurable
  classes. Finally, we identify universally consistent sequences of POVM classes.
  Technical components of this work include computations involving tensor products,
  trace and uniform convergence bounds. "
