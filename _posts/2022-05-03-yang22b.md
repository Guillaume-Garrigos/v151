title: " Faster Single-loop Algorithms for Minimax Optimization without Strong Concavity "
abstract: " Gradient descent ascent (GDA), the simplest single-loop algorithm for
  nonconvex minimax optimization, is widely used in practical applications such as
  generative adversarial networks (GANs) and adversarial training. Albeit its desirable
  simplicity, recent work shows inferior convergence rates of GDA in theory, even
  when assuming strong concavity of the objective in terms of one variable. This paper
  establishes new convergence results for two alternative single-loop algorithms –
  alternating GDA and smoothed GDA – under the mild assumption that the objective
  satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition about one variable. We prove that,
  to find an $\\epsilon$-stationary point, (i) alternating GDA and its stochastic
  variant (without mini batch) respectively require $O(\\kappa^{2} \\epsilon^{-2})$
  and $O(\\kappa^{4} \\epsilon^{-4})$ iterations, while (ii) smoothed GDA and its
  stochastic variant (without mini batch) respectively require $O(\\kappa \\epsilon^{-2})$
  and $O(\\kappa^{2} \\epsilon^{-4})$ iterations. The latter greatly improves over
  the vanilla GDA and gives the hitherto best known complexity results among single-loop
  algorithms under similar settings. We further showcase the empirical efficiency
  of these algorithms in training GANs and robust nonlinear regression. "
