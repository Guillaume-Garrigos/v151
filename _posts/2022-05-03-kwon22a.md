title: " Beta Shapley: a Unified and Noise-reduced Data Valuation Framework for Machine
  Learning "
abstract: " Data Shapley has recently been proposed as a principled framework to quantify
  the contribution of individual datum in machine learning. It can effectively identify
  helpful or harmful data points for a learning algorithm. In this paper, we propose
  Beta Shapley, which is a substantial generalization of Data Shapley. Beta Shapley
  arises naturally by relaxing the efficiency axiom of the Shapley value, which is
  not critical for machine learning settings. Beta Shapley unifies several popular
  data valuation methods and includes data Shapley as a special case. Moreover, we
  prove that Beta Shapley has several desirable statistical properties and propose
  efficient algorithms to estimate it. We demonstrate that Beta Shapley outperforms
  state-of-the-art data valuation methods on several downstream ML tasks such as:
  1) detecting mislabeled training data; 2) learning with subsamples; and 3) identifying
  points whose addition or removal have the largest positive or negative impact on
  the model. "
