title: " Stateful Offline Contextual Policy Evaluation and Learning "
abstract: " We study off-policy evaluation and learning from sequential data in a
  structured class of Markov decision processes that arise from repeated interactions
  with an exogenous sequence of arrivals with contexts, which generate unknown individual-level
  responses to agent actions. This model can be thought of as an offline generalization
  of contextual bandits with resource constraints. We formalize the relevant causal
  structure of problems such as dynamic personalized pricing and other operations
  management problems in the presence of potentially high-dimensional user types.
  The key insight is that an individual-level response is often not causally affected
  by the state variable and can therefore easily be generalized across timesteps and
  states. When this is true, we study implications for (doubly robust) off-policy
  evaluation and learning by instead leveraging single time-step evaluation, estimating
  the expectation over a single arrival via data from a population, for fitted-value
  iteration in a marginal MDP. We study sample complexity and analyze error amplification
  that leads to the persistence, rather than attenuation, of confounding error over
  time. In simulations of dynamic and capacitated pricing, we show improved out-of-sample
  policy performance in this class of relevant problems. "
