title: " Two-Sample Test with Kernel Projected Wasserstein Distance "
abstract: " We develop a kernel projected Wasserstein distance for the two-sample
  test, an essential building block in statistics and machine learning: given two
  sets of samples, to determine whether they are from the same distribution. This
  method operates by finding the nonlinear mapping in the data space which maximizes
  the distance between projected distributions. In contrast to existing works about
  projected Wasserstein distance, the proposed method circumvents the curse of dimensionality
  more efficiently. We present practical algorithms for computing this distance function
  together with the non-asymptotic uncertainty quantification of empirical estimates.
  Numerical examples validate our theoretical results and demonstrate good performance
  of the proposed method. "
