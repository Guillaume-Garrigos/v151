title: " A Manifold View of Adversarial Risk "
abstract: " The adversarial risk of a machine learning model has been widely studied.
  Most previous works assume that the data lies in the whole ambient space. We propose
  to take a new angle and take the manifold assumption into consideration. Assuming
  data lies in a manifold, we investigate two new types of adversarial risk, the normal
  adversarial risk due to perturbation along normal direction, and the in-manifold
  adversarial risk due to perturbation within the manifold. We prove that the classic
  adversarial risk can be bounded from both sides using the normal and in-manifold
  adversarial risks. We also show with a surprisingly pessimistic case that the standard
  adversarial risk can be nonzero even when both normal and in-manifold risks are
  zero. We finalize the paper with empirical studies supporting our theoretical results.
  Our results suggest the possibility of improving the robustness of a classifier
  by only focusing on the normal adversarial risk. "
