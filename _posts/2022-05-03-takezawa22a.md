title: " Fixed Support Tree-Sliced Wasserstein Barycenter "
abstract: " The Wasserstein barycenter has been widely studied in various fields,
  including natural language processing, and computer vision. However, it requires
  a high computational cost to solve the Wasserstein barycenter problem because the
  computation of the Wasserstein distance requires a quadratic time with respect to
  the number of supports. By contrast, the Wasserstein distance on a tree, called
  the tree-Wasserstein distance, can be computed in linear time and allows for the
  fast comparison of a large number of distributions. In this study, we propose a
  barycenter under the tree-Wasserstein distance, called the fixed support tree-Wasserstein
  barycenter (FS-TWB) and its extension, called the fixed support tree-sliced Wasserstein
  barycenter (FS-TSWB). More specifically, we first show that the FS-TWB and FS-TSWB
  problems are convex optimization problems and can be solved by using the projected
  subgradient descent. Moreover, we propose a more efficient algorithm to compute
  the subgradient and objective function value by using the properties of tree-Wasserstein
  barycenter problems. Through real-world experiments, we show that, by using the
  proposed algorithm, the FS-TWB and FS-TSWB can be solved two orders of magnitude
  faster than the original Wasserstein barycenter. "
