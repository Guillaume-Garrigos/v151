title: " Provable Adversarial Robustness for Fractional Lp Threat Models "
abstract: ' In recent years, researchers have extensively studied adversarial robustness
  in a variety of threat models, including L_0, L_1, L_2, and L_infinity-norm bounded
  adversarial attacks. However, attacks bounded by fractional L_p "norms" (quasi-norms
  defined by the L_p distance with 0<p<1) have yet to be thoroughly considered. We
  proactively propose a defense with several desirable properties: it provides provable
  (certified) robustness, scales to ImageNet, and yields deterministic (rather than
  high-probability) certified guarantees when applied to quantized data (e.g., images).
  Our technique for fractional L_p robustness constructs expressive, deep classifiers
  that are globally Lipschitz with respect to the L_p^p metric, for any 0<p<1. However,
  our method is even more general: we can construct classifiers which are globally
  Lipschitz with respect to any metric defined as the sum of concave functions of
  components. Our approach builds on a recent work, Levine and Feizi (2021), which
  provides a provable defense against L_1 attacks. However, we demonstrate that our
  proposed guarantees are highly non-vacuous, compared to the trivial solution of
  using (Levine and Feizi, 2021) directly and applying norm inequalities. '
