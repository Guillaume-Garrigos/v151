title: " Asynchronous Distributed Optimization with Stochastic Delays "
abstract: " We study asynchronous finite sum minimization in a distributed-data setting
  with a central parameter server. While asynchrony is well understood in parallel
  settings where the data is accessible by all machines—e.g., modifications of variance-reduced
  gradient algorithms like SAGA work well—little is known for the distributed-data
  setting. We develop an algorithm ADSAGA based on SAGA for the distributed-data setting,
  in which the data is partitioned between many machines. We show that with $m$ machines,
  under a natural stochastic delay model with an mean delay of $m$, ADSAGA converges
  in $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\left(n + \\sqrt{m}\\kappa\\right)\\log(1/\\epsilon)\\right)$
  iterations, where $n$ is the number of component functions, and $\\kappa$ is a condition
  number. This complexity sits squarely between the complexity $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\left(n
  + \\kappa\\right)\\log(1/\\epsilon)\\right)$ of SAGA without delays and the complexity
  $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\left(n + m\\kappa\\right)\\log(1/\\epsilon)\\right)$ of parallel
  asynchronous algorithms where the delays are arbitrary (but bounded by $O(m)$),
  and the data is accessible by all. Existing asynchronous algorithms with distributed-data
  setting and arbitrary delays have only been shown to converge in $\\tilde{O}(n^2\\kappa\\log(1/\\epsilon))$
  iterations. We empirically compare on least-squares problems the iteration complexity
  and wallclock performance of ADSAGA to existing parallel and distributed algorithms,
  including synchronous minibatch algorithms. Our results demonstrate the wallclock
  advantage of variance-reduced asynchronous approaches over SGD or synchronous approaches. "
