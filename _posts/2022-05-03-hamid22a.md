title: " Marginalising over Stationary Kernels with Bayesian Quadrature "
abstract: " Marginalising over families of Gaussian Process kernels produces flexible
  model classes with well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Existing approaches require
  likelihood evaluations of many kernels, rendering them prohibitively expensive for
  larger datasets. We propose a Bayesian Quadrature scheme to make this marginalisation
  more efficient and thereby more practical. Through use of maximum mean discrepancies
  between distributions, we define a kernel over kernels that captures invariances
  between Spectral Mixture (SM) Kernels. Kernel samples are selected by generalising
  an information-theoretic acquisition function for warped Bayesian Quadrature. We
  show that our framework achieves more accurate predictions with better calibrated
  uncertainty than state-of-the-art baselines, especially when given limited (wall-clock)
  time budgets. "
