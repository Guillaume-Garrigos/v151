title: " Unifying Importance Based Regularisation Methods for Continual Learning "
abstract: " Continual Learning addresses the challenge of learning a number of different
  tasks sequentially. The goal of maintaining knowledge of earlier tasks without re-accessing
  them starkly conflicts with standard SGD training for artificial neural networks.
  An influential method to tackle this problem without storing old data are so-called
  regularisation approaches. They measure the importance of each parameter for solving
  a given task and subsequently protect important parameters from large changes. In
  the literature, three ways to measure parameter importance have been put forward
  and they have inspired a large body of follow-up work. Here, we present strong theoretical
  and empirical evidence that these three methods, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC),
  Synaptic Intelligence (SI) and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are surprisingly similar
  and are all linked to the same theoretical quantity. Concretely, we show that, despite
  stemming from very different motivations, both SI and MAS approximate the square
  root of the Fisher Information, with the Fisher being the theoretically justified
  basis of EWC. Moreover, we show that for SI the relation to the Fisher – and in
  fact its performance – is due to a previously unknown bias. On top of uncovering
  unknown similarities and unifying regularisation approaches, we also demonstrate
  that our insights enable practical performance improvements for large batch training. "
