title: " Optimal channel selection with discrete QCQP "
abstract: " Reducing the high computational cost of large convolutional neural networks
  is crucial when deploying the networks to resource-constrained environments. We
  first show the greedy approach of recent channel pruning methods ignores the inherent
  quadratic coupling between channels in the neighboring layers and cannot safely
  remove inactive weights during the pruning procedure. Furthermore, due to these
  inactive weights, the greedy methods cannot guarantee to satisfy the given resource
  constraints and deviate with the true objective. In this regard, we propose a novel
  channel selection method that optimally selects channels via discrete QCQP, which
  provably prevents any inactive weights and guarantees to meet the resource constraints
  tightly in terms of FLOPs, memory usage, and network size. We also propose a quadratic
  model that accurately estimates the actual inference time of the pruned network,
  which allows us to adopt inference time as a resource constraint option. Furthermore,
  we generalize our method to extend the selection granularity beyond channels and
  handle non-sequential connections. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet show
  our proposed pruning method outperforms other fixed-importance channel pruning methods
  on various network architectures. "
