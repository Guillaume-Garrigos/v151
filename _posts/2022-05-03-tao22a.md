title: " Optimal Rates of (Locally) Differentially Private Heavy-tailed Multi-Armed
  Bandits "
abstract: " In this paper we investigate the problem of stochastic multi-armed bandits
  (MAB) in the (local) differential privacy (DP/LDP) model. Unlike previous results
  that assume bounded/sub-Gaussian reward distributions, we focus on the setting where
  each armâ€™s reward distribution only has $(1+v)$-th moment with some $v\\in (0, 1]$.
  In the first part, we study the problem in the central $\\epsilon$-DP model. We
  first provide a near-optimal result by developing a private and robust Upper Confidence
  Bound (UCB) algorithm. Then, we improve the result via a private and robust version
  of the Successive Elimination (SE) algorithm. Finally, we establish the lower bound
  to show that the instance-dependent regret of our improved algorithm is optimal.
  In the second part, we study the problem in the $\\epsilon$-LDP model. We propose
  an algorithm that can be seen as locally private and robust version of SE algorithm,
  which provably achieves (near) optimal rates for both instance-dependent and instance-independent
  regret. Our results reveal differences between the problem of private MAB with bounded/sub-Gaussian
  rewards and heavy-tailed rewards. To achieve these (near) optimal rates, we develop
  several new hard instances and private robust estimators as byproducts, which might
  be used to other related problems. Finally, experiments also support our theoretical
  findings and show the effectiveness of our algorithms. "
