title: " Pulling back information geometry "
abstract: " Latent space geometry has shown itself to provide a rich and rigorous
  framework for interacting with the latent variables of deep generative models. The
  existing theory, however, relies on the decoder being a Gaussian distribution as
  its simple reparametrization allows us to interpret the generating process as a
  random projection of a deterministic manifold. Consequently, this approach breaks
  down when applied to decoders that are not as easily reparametrized. We here propose
  to use the Fisher-Rao metric associated with the space of decoder distributions
  as a reference metric, which we pull back to the latent space. We show that we can
  achieve meaningful latent geometries for a wide range of decoder distributions for
  which the previous theory was not applicable, opening the door to ’black box’ latent
  geometries. "
