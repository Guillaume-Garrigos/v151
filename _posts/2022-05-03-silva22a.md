title: " Cross-Loss Influence Functions to Explain Deep Network Representations "
abstract: ' As machine learning is increasingly deployed in the real world, it is
  paramount that we develop the tools necessary to analyze the decision-making of
  the models we train and deploy to end-users. Recently, researchers have shown that
  influence functions, a statistical measure of sample impact, can approximate the
  effects of training samples on classification accuracy for deep neural networks.
  However, this prior work only applies to supervised learning, where training and
  testing share an objective function. No approaches currently exist for estimating
  the influence of unsupervised training examples for deep learning models. To bring
  explainability to unsupervised and semi-supervised training regimes, we derive the
  first theoretical and empirical demonstration that influence functions can be extended
  to handle mismatched training and testing (i.e., "cross-loss") settings. Our formulation
  enables us to compute the influence in an unsupervised learning setup, explain cluster
  memberships, and identify and augment biases in language models. Our experiments
  show that our cross-loss influence estimates even exceed matched-objective influence
  estimation relative to ground-truth sample impact. '
