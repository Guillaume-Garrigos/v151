title: " Faster One-Sample Stochastic Conditional Gradient Method for Composite Convex
  Minimization "
abstract: " We propose a stochastic conditional gradient method (CGM) for minimizing
  convex finite-sum objectives formed as a sum of smooth and non-smooth terms. Existing
  CGM variants for this template either suffer from slow convergence rates, or require
  carefully increasing the batch size over the course of the algorithm’s execution,
  which leads to computing full gradients. In contrast, the proposed method, equipped
  with a stochastic average gradient (SAG) estimator, requires only one sample per
  iteration. Nevertheless, it guarantees fast convergence rates on par with more sophisticated
  variance reduction techniques. In applications we put special emphasis on problems
  with a large number of separable constraints. Such problems are prevalent among
  semidefinite programming (SDP) formulations arising in machine learning and theoretical
  computer science. We provide numerical experiments on matrix completion, unsupervised
  clustering, and sparsest-cut SDPs. "
