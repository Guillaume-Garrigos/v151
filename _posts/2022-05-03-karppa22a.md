title: " DEANN: Speeding up Kernel-Density Estimation using Approximate Nearest Neighbor
  Search "
abstract: " Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a nonparametric method for estimatig
  the shape of a density function, given a set of samples from the distribution. Recently,
  locality-sensitive hashing, originally proposed as a tool for nearest neighbor search,
  has been shown to enable fast KDE data structures. However, these approaches do
  not take advantage of the many other advances that have been made in algorithms
  for nearest neighbor algorithms. We present an algorithm called Density Estimation
  from Approximate Nearest Neighbors (DEANN) where we apply Approximate Nearest Neighbor
  (ANN) algorithms as a black box subroutine to compute an unbiased KDE. The idea
  is to find points that have a large contribution to the KDE using ANN, compute their
  contribution exactly, and approximate the remainder with Random Sampling (RS). We
  present a theoretical argument that supports the idea that an ANN subroutine can
  speed up the evaluation. Furthermore, we provide a C++ implementation with a Python
  interface that can make use of an arbitrary ANN implementation as a subroutine for
  KDE evaluation. We show empirically that our implementation outperforms state of
  the art implementations in all high dimensional datasets we considered, and matches
  the performance of RS in cases where the ANN yield no gains in performance. "
