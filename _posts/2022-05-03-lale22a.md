title: " Reinforcement Learning with Fast Stabilization in Linear Dynamical Systems "
abstract: " In this work, we study model-based reinforcement learning (RL) in unknown
  stabilizable linear dynamical systems. When learning a dynamical system, one needs
  to stabilize the unknown dynamics in order to avoid system blow-ups. We propose
  an algorithm that certifies fast stabilization of the underlying system by effectively
  exploring the environment with an improved exploration strategy. We show that the
  proposed algorithm attains $\\Tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret after $T$ time
  steps of agent-environment interaction. We also show that the regret of the proposed
  algorithm has only a polynomial dependence in the problem dimensions, which gives
  an exponential improvement over the prior methods. Our improved exploration method
  is simple, yet efficient, and it combines a sophisticated exploration policy in
  RL with an isotropic exploration strategy to achieve fast stabilization and improved
  regret. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other
  popular methods in several adaptive control tasks. "
