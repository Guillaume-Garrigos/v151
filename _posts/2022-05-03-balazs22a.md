title: " Adaptively Partitioning Max-Affine Estimators for Convex Regression "
abstract: " This paper considers convex shape-restricted nonparametric regression
  over subgaussian domain and noise with the squared loss. It introduces a tractable
  convex piecewise-linear estimator which precomputes a partition of the training
  data by an adaptive version of farthest-point clustering, approximately fits hyperplanes
  over the partition cells by minimizing the regularized empirical risk, and projects
  the result into the max-affine class. The analysis provides an upper bound on the
  generalization error of this estimator matching the rate of Lipschitz nonparametric
  regression and proves its adaptivity to the intrinsic dimension of the data mitigating
  the effect of the curse of dimensionality. The experiments conclude with competitive
  performance, improved overfitting robustness, and significant computational savings
  compared to existing convex regression methods. "
