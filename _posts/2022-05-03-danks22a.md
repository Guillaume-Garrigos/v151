title: " Derivative-Based Neural Modelling of Cumulative Distribution Functions for
  Survival Analysis "
abstract: " Survival models — particularly those able to account for patient comorbidities
  via competing risks analysis — offer valuable prognostic information to clinicians
  making critical decisions and represent a growing area of application for machine
  learning approaches. However, current methods typically involve restrictive parameterisations,
  discretisation of time or the modelling of only one event cause. In this paper,
  we highlight how general cumulative distribution functions can be naturally expressed
  via neural network-based ordinary differential equations and how this observation
  can be utilised in survival analysis. In particular, we present DeSurv, a neural
  derivative-based approach capable of avoiding aforementioned restrictions and flexibly
  modelling competing-risk survival data in continuous time. We apply DeSurv to both
  single-risk and competing-risk synthetic and real-world datasets and obtain results
  which compare favourably with current state-of-the-art models. "
