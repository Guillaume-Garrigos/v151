title: " An Optimal Algorithm for Strongly Convex Minimization under Affine Constraints "
abstract: " Optimization problems under affine constraints appear in various areas
  of machine learning. We consider the task of minimizing a smooth strongly convex
  function F(x) under the affine constraint Kx = b, with an oracle providing evaluations
  of the gradient of F and multiplications by K and its transpose. We provide lower
  bounds on the number of gradient computations and matrix multiplications to achieve
  a given accuracy. Then we propose an accelerated primal-dual algorithm achieving
  these lower bounds. Our algorithm is the first optimal algorithm for this class
  of problems. "
