title: " A prior-based approximate latent Riemannian metric "
abstract: " Stochastic generative models enable us to capture the geometric structure
  of a data manifold lying in a high dimensional space through a Riemannian metric
  in the latent space. However, its practical use is rather limited mainly due to
  inevitable functionality problems and computational complexity. In this work we
  propose a surrogate conformal Riemannian metric in the latent space of a generative
  model that is simple, efficient and robust. This metric is based on a learnable
  prior that we propose to learn using a basic energy-based model. We theoretically
  analyze the behavior of the proposed metric and show that it is sensible to use
  in practice. We demonstrate experimentally the efficiency and robustness, as well
  as the behavior of the new approximate metric. Also, we show the applicability of
  the proposed methodology for data analysis in the life sciences. "
