title: " Extragradient Method: O(1/K) Last-Iterate Convergence for Monotone Variational
  Inequalities and Connections With Cocoercivity "
abstract: " Extragradient method (EG) (Korpelevich, 1976) is one of the most popular
  methods for solving saddle point and variational inequalities problems (VIP). Despite
  its long history and significant attention in the optimization community, there
  remain important open questions about convergence of EG. In this paper, we resolve
  one of such questions and derive the first last-iterate O(1/K) convergence rate
  for EG for monotone and Lipschitz VIP without any additional assumptions on the
  operator unlike the only known result of this type (Golowich et al., 2020) that
  relies on the Lipschitzness of the Jacobian of the operator. The rate is given in
  terms of reducing the squared norm of the operator. Moreover, we establish several
  results on the (non-)cocoercivity of the update operators of EG, Optimistic Gradient
  Method, and Hamiltonian Gradient Method, when the original operator is monotone
  and Lipschitz. "
