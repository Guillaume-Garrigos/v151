title: " On the Oracle Complexity of Higher-Order Smooth Non-Convex Finite-Sum Optimization "
abstract: " We prove lower bounds for higher-order methods in smooth non-convex finite-sum
  optimization. Our contribution is threefold: We first show that a deterministic
  algorithm cannot profit from the finite-sum structure of the objective and that
  simulating a pth-order regularized method on the whole function by constructing
  exact gradient information is optimal up to constant factors. We further show lower
  bounds for randomized algorithms and compare them with the best-known upper bounds.
  To address some gaps between the bounds, we propose a new second-order smoothness
  assumption that can be seen as an analogue of the first-order mean-squared smoothness
  assumption. We prove that it is sufficient to ensure state-of-the-art convergence
  guarantees while allowing for a sharper lower bound. "
