title: " Nearly Tight Convergence Bounds for Semi-discrete Entropic Optimal Transport "
abstract: " We derive nearly tight and non-asymptotic convergence bounds for solutions
  of entropic semi-discrete optimal transport. These bounds quantify the stability
  of the dual solutions of the regularized problem (sometimes called Sinkhorn potentials)
  w.r.t. the regularization parameter, for which we ensure a better than Lipschitz
  dependence. Such facts may be a first step towards a mathematical justification
  of $\\varepsilon$-scaling heuristics for the numerical resolution of regularized
  semi-discrete optimal transport. Our results also entail a non-asymptotic and tight
  expansion of the difference between the entropic and the unregularized costs. "
