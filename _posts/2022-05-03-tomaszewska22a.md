title: " Duel-based Deep Learning system for solving IQ tests "
abstract: " One of the relevant aspects of Artificial General Intelligence is the
  ability of machines to demonstrate abstract reasoning skills, for instance, through
  solving (human) IQ tests. This work presents a new approach to machine IQ tests
  solving formulated as Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPMs), called Duel-IQ. The proposed
  solution incorporates the concept of a tournament in which the best answer is chosen
  based on a set of duels between candidate RPM answers. The three relevant aspects
  are: (1) low computational and design complexity, (2) proposition of two schemes
  of pairing up candidate answers for the duels and (3) evaluation of the system on
  a dataset of shapes other than those used for training. Depending on a particular
  variant, the system reaches up to $82.8%$ accuracy on average in RPM tasks with
  5 candidate answers and is on par with human performance and superior to other literature
  approaches of comparable complexity when training and test sets are from the same
  distribution. "
