title: " Neural Enhanced Dynamic Message Passing "
abstract: " Predicting stochastic spreading processes on complex networks is critical
  in epidemic control, opinion propagation, and viral marketing. We focus on the problem
  of inferring the time-dependent marginal probabilities of states for each node which
  collectively quantifies the spreading results. Dynamic Message Passing (DMP) has
  been developed as an efficient inference algorithm for several spreading models,
  and it is asymptotically exact on locally tree-like networks. However, DMP can struggle
  in diffusion networks with lots of local loops. We address this limitation by using
  Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to learn the dependency amongst messages implicitly.
  Specifically, we propose a hybrid model in which the GNN module runs jointly with
  DMP equations. The GNN module refines the aggregated messages in DMP iterations
  by learning from simulation data. We demonstrate numerically that after training,
  our modelâ€™s inference accuracy substantially outperforms DMP in conditions of various
  network structure and dynamics parameters. Moreover, compared to pure data-driven
  models, the proposed hybrid model has a better generalization ability for out-of-training
  cases, profiting from the explicitly utilized dynamics priors in the hybrid model.
  A PyTorch implementation of our model is at https://github.com/FeiGSSS/NEDMP. "
