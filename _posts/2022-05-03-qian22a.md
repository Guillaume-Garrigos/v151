title: " Basis Matters: Better Communication-Efficient Second Order Methods for Federated
  Learning "
abstract: " Recent advances in distributed optimization have shown that Newton-type
  methods with proper communication compression mechanisms can guarantee fast local
  rates and low communication cost compared to first order methods. We discover that
  the communication cost of these methods can be further reduced, sometimes dramatically
  so, with a surprisingly simple trick: Basis Learn (BL). The idea is to transform
  the usual representation of the local Hessians via a change of basis in the space
  of matrices and apply compression tools to the new representation. To demonstrate
  the potential of using custom bases, we design a new Newton-type method (BL1), which
  reduces communication cost via both BL technique and bidirectional compression mechanism.
  Furthermore, we present two alternative extensions (BL2 and BL3) to partial participation
  to accommodate federated learning applications. We prove local linear and superlinear
  rates independent of the condition number. Finally, we support our claims with numerical
  experiments by comparing several first and second order methods. "
