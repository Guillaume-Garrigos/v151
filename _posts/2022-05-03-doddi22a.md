title: " Efficient and passive learning of networked dynamical systems driven by non-white
  exogenous inputs "
abstract: " We consider a networked linear dynamical system with p agents/nodes. We
  study the problem of learning the underlying graph of interactions/dependencies
  from observations of the nodal trajectories over a time-interval T. We present a
  regularized non-casual consistent estimator for this problem and analyze its sample
  complexity over two regimes: (a) where the interval T consists of n i.i.d. observation
  windows of length T/n (restart and record), and (b) where T is one continuous observation
  window (consecutive). Using the theory of M-estimators, we show that the estimator
  recovers the underlying interactions, in either regime, in a time-interval that
  is logarithmic in the system size p. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
  work to analyze the sample complexity of learning linear dynamical systems driven
  by unobserved not-white wide-sense stationary (WSS) inputs. "
