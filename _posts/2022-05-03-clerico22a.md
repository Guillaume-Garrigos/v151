title: " Conditionally Gaussian PAC-Bayes "
abstract: " Recent studies have empirically investigated different methods to train
  stochastic neural networks on a classification task by optimising a PAC-Bayesian
  bound via stochastic gradient descent. Most of these procedures need to replace
  the misclassification error with a surrogate loss, leading to a mismatch between
  the optimisation objective and the actual generalisation bound. The present paper
  proposes a novel training algorithm that optimises the PAC-Bayesian bound, without
  relying on any surrogate loss. Empirical results show that this approach outperforms
  currently available PAC-Bayesian training methods. "
