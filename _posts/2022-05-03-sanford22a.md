title: " Expressivity of Neural Networks via Chaotic Itineraries beyond Sharkovsky’s
  Theorem "
abstract: " Given a target function $f$, how large must a neural network be in order
  to approximate $f$? Recent works examine this basic question on neural network expressivity
  from the lens of dynamical systems and provide novel “depth-vs-width” tradeoffs
  for a large family of functions $f$. They suggest that such tradeoffs are governed
  by the existence of periodic points or cycles in $f$. Our work, by further deploying
  dynamical systems concepts, illuminates a more subtle connection between periodicity
  and expressivity: we prove that periodic points alone lead to suboptimal depth-width
  tradeoffs and we improve upon them by demonstrating that certain “chaotic itineraries”
  give stronger exponential tradeoffs, even in regimes where previous analyses only
  imply polynomial gaps. Contrary to prior works, our bounds are nearly-optimal, tighten
  as the period increases, and handle strong notions of inapproximability (e.g., constant
  $L_1$ error). More broadly, we identify a phase transition to the chaotic regime
  that exactly coincides with an abrupt shift in other notions of function complexity,
  including VC-dimension and topological entropy. "
