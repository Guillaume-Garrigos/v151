title: " Improved Algorithms for Misspecified Linear Markov Decision Processes "
abstract: " For the misspecified linear Markov decision process (MLMDP) model of Jin
  et al. [2020], we propose an algorithm with three desirable properties. (P1) Its
  regret after K episodes scales as Kmax{\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}mis,\\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}tol},
  where \\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}mis is the degree of misspecification and \\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}tol
  is a user-specified error tolerance. (P2) Its space and per-episode time complexities
  remain bounded as $K\\rightarrow\\infty$. (P3) It does not require \\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}mis
  as input. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm satisfying all three properties.
  For concrete choices of \\ensuremath{\\varepsilon}tol, we also improve existing
  regret bounds (up to log factors) while achieving either (P2) or (P3) (existing
  algorithms satisfy neither). At a high level, our algorithm generalizes (to MLMDPs)
  and refines the Sup-Lin-UCB algorithm, which Takemura et al. [2021] recently showed
  satisfies (P3) in the contextual bandit setting. We also provide an intuitive interpretation
  of their result, which informs the design of our algorithm. "
