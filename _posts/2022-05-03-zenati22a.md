title: " Efficient Kernelized UCB for Contextual Bandits "
abstract: " In this paper, we tackle the computational efficiency of kernelized UCB
  algorithms in contextual bandits. While standard methods require a $\\mathcal{O}(CT^3)$
  complexity where $T$ is the horizon and the constant $C$ is related to optimizing
  the UCB rule, we propose an efficient contextual algorithm for large-scale problems.
  Specifically, our method relies on incremental Nyström approximations of the joint
  kernel embedding of contexts and actions. This allows us to achieve a complexity
  of $\\mathcal{O}(CTm^2)$ where $m$ is the number of Nyström points. To recover the
  same regret as the standard kernelized UCB algorithm, $m$ needs to be of order of
  the effective dimension of the problem, which is at most $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$
  and nearly constant in some cases. "
