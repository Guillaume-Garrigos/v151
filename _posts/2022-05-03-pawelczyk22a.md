title: " Exploring Counterfactual Explanations Through the Lens of Adversarial Examples:
  A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis "
abstract: " As machine learning (ML) models becomemore widely deployed in high-stakes
  applications, counterfactual explanations have emerged as key tools for providing
  actionable model explanations in practice. Despite the growing popularity of counterfactual
  explanations, the theoretical understanding of these explanations is still lacking
  behind. In this work, we systematically analyze counterfactual explanations through
  the lens of adversarial examples. We do so by formalizing the similarities between
  popular counterfactual explanation and adversarial example generation methods identifying
  conditions when they are equivalent. We then derive upper bounds between the solutions
  output by counterfactual explanation and adversarial example generation methods,
  which we validate on several real world data sets. By establishing these theoretical
  and empirical similarities between counterfactual explanations and adversarial examples,
  our work raises fundamental questions about the design and development of existing
  counterfactual explanation algorithms. "
