title: " Robust Stochastic Linear Contextual Bandits Under Adversarial Attacks "
abstract: " Stochastic linear contextual bandit algorithms have substantial applications
  in practice, such as recommender systems, online advertising, clinical trials, etc.
  Recent works show that optimal bandit algorithms are vulnerable to adversarial attacks
  and can fail completely in the presence of attacks. Existing robust bandit algorithms
  only work for the non-contextual setting under the attack of rewards and cannot
  improve the robustness in the general and popular contextual bandit environment.
  In addition, none of the existing methods can defend against attacked context. In
  this work, we provide the first robust bandit algorithm for stochastic linear contextual
  bandit setting under a fully adaptive and omniscient attack with sub-linear regret.
  Our algorithm not only works under the attack of rewards, but also under attacked
  context. Moreover, it does not need any information about the attack budget or the
  particular form of the attack. We provide theoretical guarantees for our proposed
  algorithm and show by experiments that our proposed algorithm improves the robustness
  against various kinds of popular attacks. "
