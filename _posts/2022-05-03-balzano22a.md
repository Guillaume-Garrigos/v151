title: " On the equivalence of Oja’s algorithm and GROUSE "
abstract: " The analysis of streaming PCA has gained significant traction through
  the analysis of an early simple variant: Oja’s algorithm, which implements online
  projected gradient descent for the trace objective. Several other streaming PCA
  algorithms have been developed, each with their own performance guarantees or empirical
  studies, and the question arises whether there is a relationship between the algorithms.
  We show that the Grassmannian Rank-One Subspace Estimation (GROUSE) algorithm is
  indeed equivalent to Oja’s algorithm in the sense that, at each iteration, given
  a step size for one of the algorithms, we may construct a step size for the other
  algorithm that results in an identical update. This allows us to apply all results
  on one algorithm to the other. In particular, we have (1) better global convergence
  guarantees of GROUSE to the global minimizer of the PCA objective with full data;
  and (2) local convergence guarantees for Oja’s algorithm with incomplete or compressed
  data. "
