title: " Debiasing Samples from Online Learning Using Bootstrap "
abstract: " It has been recently shown in the literature (Nie et al, 2018; Shin et
  al, 2019a,b) that the sample averages from online learning experiments are biased
  when used to estimate the mean reward. To correct the bias, off-policy evaluation
  methods, including importance sampling and doubly robust estimators, typically calculate
  the conditional propensity score, which is ill-defined for non-randomized policies
  such as UCB. This paper provides a procedure to debias the samples using bootstrap,
  which doesnâ€™t require the knowledge of the reward distribution and can be applied
  to any adaptive policies. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effective bias reduction
  for samples generated by popular multi-armed bandit algorithms such as Explore-Then-Commit
  (ETC), UCB, Thompson sampling (TS) and $\\epsilon$-greedy (EG). We analyze and provide
  theoretical justifications for the procedure under the ETC algorithm, including
  the asymptotic convergence of the bias decay rate in the real and bootstrap worlds. "
