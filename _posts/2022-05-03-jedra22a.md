title: " Minimal Expected Regret in Linear Quadratic Control "
abstract: " We consider the problem of online learning in Linear Quadratic Control
  systems whose state transition and state-action transition matrices $A$ and $B$
  may be initially unknown. We devise an online learning algorithm and provide guarantees
  on its expected regret. This regret at time $T$ is upper bounded (i) by $\\widetilde{O}((d_u+d_x)\\sqrt{d_xT})$
  when $A$ and $B$ are unknown, (ii) by $\\widetilde{O}(d_x^2\\log(T))$ if only $A$
  is unknown, and (iii) by $\\widetilde{O}(d_x(d_u+d_x)\\log(T))$ if only $B$ is unknown
  and under some mild non-degeneracy condition ($d_x$ and $d_u$ denote the dimensions
  of the state and of the control input, respectively). These regret scalings are
  minimal in $T$, $d_x$ and $d_u$ as they match existing lower bounds in scenario
  (i) when $d_x\\le d_u$ [SF20], and in scenario (ii) [Lai86]. We conjecture that
  our upper bounds are also optimal in scenario (iii) (there is no known lower bound
  in this setting). Existing online algorithms proceed in epochs of (typically exponentially)
  growing durations. The control policy is fixed within each epoch, which considerably
  simplifies the analysis of the estimation error on $A$ and $B$ and hence of the
  regret. Our algorithm departs from this design choice: it is a simple variant of
  certainty-equivalence regulators, where the estimates of $A$ and $B$ and the resulting
  control policy can be updated as frequently as we wish, possibly at every step.
  Quantifying the impact of such a constantly-varying control policy on the performance
  of these estimates and on the regret constitutes one of the technical challenges
  tackled in this paper. "
