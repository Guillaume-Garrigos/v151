title: " On Structured Filtering-Clustering: Global Error Bound and Optimal First-Order
  Algorithms "
abstract: " The filtering-clustering models, including trend filtering and convex
  clustering, have become an important source of ideas and modeling tools in machine
  learning and related fields. The statistical guarantee of optimal solutions in these
  models has been extensively studied yet the investigations on the computational
  aspect have remained limited. In particular, practitioners often employ the first-order
  algorithms in real-world applications and are impressed by their superior performance
  regardless of ill-conditioned structures of difference operator matrices, thus leaving
  open the problem of understanding the convergence property of first-order algorithms.
  This paper settles this open problem and contributes to the broad interplay between
  statistics and optimization by identifying a global error bound condition, which
  is satisfied by a large class of dual filtering-clustering problems, and designing
  a class of generalized dual gradient ascent algorithm, which is optimal first-order
  algorithms in deterministic, finite-sum and online settings. Our results are new
  and help explain why the filtering-clustering models can be efficiently solved by
  first-order algorithms. We also provide the detailed convergence rate analysis for
  the proposed algorithms in different settings, shedding light on their potential
  to solve the filtering-clustering models efficiently. We also conduct experiments
  on real datasets and the numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  algorithms. "
