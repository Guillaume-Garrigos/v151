title: " Multi-class classification in nonparametric active learning "
abstract: " Several works have recently focused on nonparametric active learning,
  especially in the binary classification setting under HÃ¶lder smoothness assumptions
  on the regression function. These works have highlighted the benefit of active learning
  by providing better rates of convergence compared to the passive counterpart. In
  this paper, we extend these results to multiclass classification under a more general
  smoothness assumption, which takes into account a broader class of underlying distributions.
  We present a new algorithm called MKAL for multiclass K-nearest neighbors active
  learning, and prove its theoretical benefits. Additionally, we empirically study
  MKAL on several datasets and discuss its merits and potential improvements. "
