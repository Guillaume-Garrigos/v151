title: " Predicting the utility of search spaces for black-box optimization: a simple,
  budget-aware approach "
abstract: " Black box optimization requires specifying a search space to explore for
  solutions, e.g. a d-dimensional compact space, and this choice is critical for getting
  the best results at a reasonable budget. Unfortunately, determining a high quality
  search space can be challenging in many applications. For example, when tuning hyperparameters
  for machine learning pipelines on a new problem given a limited budget, one must
  strike a balance between excluding potentially promising regions and keeping the
  search space small enough to be tractable. The goal of this work is to motivate—through
  example applications in tuning deep neural networks—the problem of predicting the
  quality of search spaces conditioned on budgets, as well as to provide a simple
  scoring method based on a utility function applied to a probabilistic response surface
  model, similar to Bayesian optimization. We show that the method we present can
  compute meaningful budget-conditional scores in a variety of situations. We also
  provide experimental evidence that accurate scores can be useful in constructing
  and pruning search spaces. Ultimately, we believe scoring search spaces should become
  standard practice in the experimental workflow for deep learning. "
