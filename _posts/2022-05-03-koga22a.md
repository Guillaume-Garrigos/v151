title: " Privacy Amplification by Subsampling in Time Domain "
abstract: " Aggregate time-series data like traffic flow and site occupancy repeatedly
  sample statistics from a population across time. Such data can be profoundly useful
  for understanding trends within a given population, but also pose a significant
  privacy risk, potentially revealing e.g., who spends time where. Producing a private
  version of a time-series satisfying the standard definition of Differential Privacy
  (DP) is challenging due to the large influence a single participant can have on
  the sequence: if an individual can contribute to each time step, the amount of additive
  noise needed to satisfy privacy increases linearly with the number of time steps
  sampled. As such, if a signal spans a long duration or is oversampled, an excessive
  amount of noise must be added, drowning out underlying trends. However, in many
  applications an individual realistically cannot participate at every time step.
  When this is the case, we observe that the influence of a single participant (sensitivity)
  can be reduced by subsampling and/or filtering in time, while still meeting privacy
  requirements. Using a novel analysis, we show this significant reduction in sensitivity
  and propose a corresponding class of privacy mechanisms. We demonstrate the utility
  benefits of these techniques empirically with real-world and synthetic time-series
  data. "
