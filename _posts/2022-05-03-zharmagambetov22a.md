title: " Learning Interpretable, Tree-Based Projection Mappings for Nonlinear Embeddings "
abstract: " Model interpretability is a topic of renewed interest given todayâ€™s widespread
  practical use of machine learning, and the need to trust or understand automated
  predictions. We consider the problem of optimally learning interpretable out-of-sample
  mappings for nonlinear embedding methods such as $t$-SNE. We argue for the use of
  sparse oblique decision trees because they strike a good tradeoff between accuracy
  and interpretability which can be controlled via a hyperparameter, thus allowing
  one to achieve a model with a desired explanatory complexity. The resulting optimization
  problem is difficult because decision trees are not differentiable. By using an
  equivalent formulation of the problem, we give an algorithm that can learn such
  a tree for any given nonlinear embedding objective. We illustrate experimentally
  how the resulting trees provide insights into the data beyond what a simple 2D visualization
  of the embedding does. "
