title: " Forward Looking Best-Response Multiplicative Weights Update Methods for Bilinear
  Zero-sum Games "
abstract: " Our work focuses on extra gradient learning algorithms for finding Nash
  equilibria in bilinear zero-sum games. The proposed method, which can be formally
  considered as a variant of Optimistic Mirror Descent (Mertikopoulos et al., 2019),
  uses a large learning rate for the intermediate gradient step which essentially
  leads to computing (approximate) best response strategies against the profile of
  the previous iteration. Although counter-intuitive at first sight due to the irrationally
  large, for an iterative algorithm, intermediate learning step, we prove that the
  method guarantees last-iterate convergence to an equilibrium. Particularly, we show
  that the algorithm reaches first an $\\eta^{1/\\rho}$-approximate Nash equilibrium,
  with $\\rho > 1$, by decreasing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of each iterate
  by at least $\\Omega(\\eta^{1+\\frac{1}{\\rho}})$, for sufficiently small learning
  rate $\\eta$, until the method becomes a contracting map, and converges to the exact
  equilibrium. Furthermore, we perform experimental comparisons with the optimistic
  variant of the multiplicative weights update method, by Daskalakis and Panageas
  (2019) and show that our algorithm has significant practical potential since it
  offers substantial gains in terms of accelerated convergence. "
