title: " Tight bounds for minimum $\\ell_1$-norm interpolation of noisy data "
abstract: ' We provide matching upper and lower bounds of order $\sigma^2/\log(d/n)$
  for the prediction error of the minimum $\ell_1$-norm interpolator, a.k.a. basis
  pursuit. Our result is tight up to negligible terms when $d \gg n$, and is the first
  to imply asymptotic consistency of noisy minimum-norm interpolation for isotropic
  features and sparse ground truths. Our work complements the literature on "benign
  overfitting" for minimum $\ell_2$-norm interpolation, where asymptotic consistency
  can be achieved only when the features are effectively low-dimensional. '
