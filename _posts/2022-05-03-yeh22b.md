title: " Equivariance Discovery by Learned Parameter-Sharing "
abstract: ' Designing equivariance as an inductive bias into deep-nets has been a
  prominent approach to build effective models, e.g., a convolutional neural network
  incorporates translation equivariance. However, incorporating these inductive biases
  requires knowledge about the equivariance properties of the data, which may not
  be available, e.g., when encountering a new domain. To address this, we study how
  to "discover interpretable equivariances" from data. Specifically, we formulate
  this discovery process as an optimization problem over a modelâ€™s parameter-sharing
  schemes. We propose to use the partition distance to empirically quantify the accuracy
  of the recovered equivariance. Also, we theoretically analyze the method for Gaussian
  data and provide a bound on the mean squared gap between the studied discovery scheme
  and the oracle scheme. Empirically, we show that the approach recovers known equivariances,
  such as permutations and shifts, on sum of numbers and spatially-invariant data. '
