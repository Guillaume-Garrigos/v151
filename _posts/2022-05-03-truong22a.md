title: " On Linear Model with Markov Signal Priors "
abstract: " In this paper, we estimate free energy, average mutual information, and
  minimum mean square error (MMSE) of a linear model under the assumption that the
  source is generated by a Markov chain. Our estimates are based on the replica method
  in statistical physics. We show that under the MMSE estimator, the linear model
  with Markov sources or hidden Markov sources is decoupled into single input AWGN
  channels with state information available at both encoder and decoder where the
  state distribution follows the stationary distribution of the stochastic matrix
  of Markov chains. Numerical results show that the free energies and MSEs obtained
  via the replica method are closely approximate to their counterparts via MCMC simulations. "
