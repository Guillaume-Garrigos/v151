title: " Factorization Approach for Low-complexity Matrix Completion Problems: Exponential
  Number of Spurious Solutions and Failure of Gradient Methods "
abstract: " Burer-Monteiro (B-M) factorization approach can efficiently solve low-rank
  matrix optimization problems under the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) condition.
  It is natural to ask whether B-M factorization-based methods can succeed on any
  low-rank matrix optimization problems with low information-theoretic complexity,
  i.e., polynomial-time solvable problems that have a unique solution. We provide
  negative answer to this question. We investigate the landscape of B-M factorized
  polynomial-time solvable matrix completion (MC) problems, which are the most popular
  subclass of low-rank matrix optimization problems without the RIP condition. We
  construct an instance of polynomial-time solvable MC problems with exponentially
  many spurious local minima, which leads to the failure of most gradient-based methods.
  We define a new complexity metric that measures the solvability of low-rank matrix
  optimization problems based on B-M factorization approach. In addition, we show
  that more measurements can deteriorate the landscape, which further reveals the
  unfavorable behavior of B-M factorization. "
