title: " Structured Multi-task Learning for Molecular Property Prediction "
abstract: " Multi-task learning for molecular property prediction is becoming increasingly
  important in drug discovery. However, in contrast to other domains, the performance
  of multi-task learning in drug discovery is still not satisfying as the number of
  labeled data for each task is too limited, which calls for additional data to complement
  the data scarcity. In this paper, we study multi-task learning for molecular property
  prediction in a novel setting, where a relation graph between tasks is available.
  We first construct a dataset including around 400 tasks as well as a task relation
  graph. Then to better utilize such relation graph, we propose a method called SGNN-EBM
  to systematically investigate the structured task modeling from two perspectives.
  (1) In the latent space, we model the task representations by applying a state graph
  neural network (SGNN) on the relation graph. (2) In the output space, we employ
  structured prediction with the energy-based model (EBM), which can be efficiently
  trained through noise-contrastive estimation (NCE) approach. Empirical results justify
  the effectiveness of SGNN-EBM. Code is available on https://github.com/chao1224/SGNN-EBM. "
