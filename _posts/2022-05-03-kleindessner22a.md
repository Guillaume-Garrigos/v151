title: " Pairwise Fairness for Ordinal Regression "
abstract: " We initiate the study of fairness for ordinal regression. We adapt two
  fairness notions previously considered in fair ranking and propose a strategy for
  training a predictor that is approximately fair according to either notion. Our
  predictor has the form of a threshold model, composed of a scoring function and
  a set of thresholds, and our strategy is based on a reduction to fair binary classification
  for learning the scoring function and local search for choosing the thresholds.
  We provide generalization guarantees on the error and fairness violation of our
  predictor, and we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach in extensive experiments. "
