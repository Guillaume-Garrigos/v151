title: " Wide Mean-Field Bayesian Neural Networks Ignore the Data "
abstract: " Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) combine the expressive power of deep learning
  with the advantages of Bayesian formalism. In recent years, the analysis of wide,
  deep BNNs has provided theoretical insight into their priors and posteriors. However,
  we have no analogous insight into their posteriors under approximate inference.
  In this work, we show that mean-field variational inference <em>entirely fails to
  model the data</em> when the network width is large and the activation function
  is odd. Specifically, for fully-connected BNNs with odd activation functions and
  a homoscedastic Gaussian likelihood, we show that the <em>optimal</em> mean-field
  variational posterior predictive (i.e., function space) distribution converges to
  the prior predictive distribution as the width tends to infinity. We generalize
  aspects of this result to other likelihoods. Our theoretical results are suggestive
  of underfitting behavior previously observered in BNNs. While our convergence bounds
  are non-asymptotic and constants in our analysis can be computed, they are currently
  too loose to be applicable in standard training regimes. Finally, we show that the
  optimal approximate posterior need not tend to the prior if the activation function
  is not odd, showing that our statements cannot be generalized arbitrarily. "
