title: " Zeroth-Order Methods for Convex-Concave Min-max Problems: Applications to
  Decision-Dependent Risk Minimization "
abstract: " Min-max optimization is emerging as a key framework for analyzing problems
  of robustness to strategically and adversarially generated data. We propose the
  random reshuffling-based gradient-free Optimistic Gradient Descent-Ascent algorithm
  for solving convex-concave min-max problems with finite sum structure. We prove
  that the algorithm enjoys the same convergence rate as that of zeroth-order algorithms
  for convex minimization problems. We deploy the algorithm to solve the distributionally
  robust strategic classification problem, where gradient information is not readily
  available, by reformulating the latter into a finite dimensional convex concave
  min-max problem. Through illustrative simulations, we observe that our proposed
  approach learns models that are simultaneously robust against adversarial distribution
  shifts and strategic decisions from the data sources, and outperforms existing methods
  from the strategic classification literature. "
