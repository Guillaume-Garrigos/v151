title: " Can Pretext-Based Self-Supervised Learning Be Boosted by Downstream Data?
  A Theoretical Analysis "
abstract: " Pretext-based self-supervised learning learns the semantic representation
  via a handcrafted pretext task over unlabeled data and then uses the learned representation
  for downstream tasks, which effectively reduces the sample complexity of downstream
  tasks under Conditional Independence (CI) condition. However, the downstream sample
  complexity gets much worse if the CI condition does not hold. One interesting question
  is whether we can make the CI condition hold by using downstream data to refine
  the unlabeled data to boost self-supervised learning. At first glance, one might
  think that seeing downstream data in advance would always boost the downstream performance.
  However, we show that it is not intuitively true and point out that in some cases,
  it hurts the final performance instead. In particular, we prove both model-free
  and model-dependent lower bounds of the number of downstream samples used for data
  refinement. Moreover, we conduct various experiments on both synthetic and real-world
  datasets to verify our theoretical results. "
