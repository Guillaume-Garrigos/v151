title: " Flexible Accuracy for Differential Privacy "
abstract: " Differential Privacy (DP) has become a gold standard in privacy-preserving
  data analysis. While it provides one of the most rigorous notions of privacy, there
  are many settings where its applicability is limited. Our main contribution is in
  augmenting differential privacy with Flexible Accuracy, which allows small distortions
  in the input (e.g., dropping outliers) before measuring accuracy of the output,
  allowing one to extend DP mechanisms to high-sensitivity functions. We present mechanisms
  that can help in achieving this notion for functions that had no meaningful differentially
  private mechanisms previously. In particular, we illustrate an application to differentially
  private histograms, which in turn yields mechanisms for revealing the support of
  a dataset or the extremal values in the data. Analyses of our constructions exploit
  new versatile composition theorems that facilitate modular design. All the above
  extensions use our new definitional framework, which is in terms of “lossy Wasserstein
  distance” – a 2-parameter error measure for distributions. This may be of independent
  interest. "
