title: " Differentially Private Regression with Unbounded Covariates "
abstract: " We provide computationally efficient, differentially private algorithms
  for the classical regression settings of Least Squares Fitting, Binary Regression
  and Linear Regression with unbounded covariates. Prior to our work, privacy constraints
  in such regression settings were studied under strong a priori bounds on covariates.
  We consider the case of Gaussian marginals and extend recent differentially private
  techniques on mean and covariance estimation (Kamath et al., 2019; Karwa and Vadhan,
  2018) to the sub-gaussian regime. We provide a novel technical analysis yielding
  differentially private algorithms for the above classical regression settings. Through
  the case of Binary Regression, we capture the fundamental and widely-studied models
  of logistic regression and linearly-separable SVMs, learning an unbiased estimate
  of the true regression vector, up to a scaling factor. "
