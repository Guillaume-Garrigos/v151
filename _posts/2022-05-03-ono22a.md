title: " One-bit Submission for Locally Private Quasi-MLE: Its Asymptotic Normality
  and Limitation "
abstract: " Local differential privacy (LDP) is an information-theoretic privacy definition
  suitable for statistical surveys that involve an untrusted data curator. An LDP
  version of quasi-maximum likelihood estimator (QMLE) has been developed, but the
  existing method to build LDP QMLE is difficult to implement for a large-scale survey
  system in the real world due to long waiting time, expensive communication cost,
  and the boundedness assumption of derivative of a log-likelihood function. We provided
  alternative LDP protocols without those issues, which are potentially much easily
  deployable to a large-scale survey. We also provided sufficient conditions for the
  consistency and asymptotic normality and limitations of our protocol. Our protocol
  is less burdensome for the users, and the theoretical guarantees cover more realistic
  cases than those for the existing method. "
