title: " Solving Marginal MAP Exactly by Probabilistic Circuit Transformations "
abstract: " Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are a class of tractable probabilistic models
  that allow efficient, often linear-time, inference of queries such as marginals
  and most probable explanations (MPE). However, marginal MAP, which is central to
  many decision-making problems, remains a hard query for PCs unless they satisfy
  highly restrictive structural constraints. In this paper, we develop a pruning algorithm
  that removes parts of the PC that are irrelevant to a marginal MAP query, shrinking
  the PC while maintaining the correct solution. This pruning technique is so effective
  that we are able to build a marginal MAP solver based solely on iteratively transforming
  the circuitâ€”no search is required. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our
  approach on real-world datasets. "
