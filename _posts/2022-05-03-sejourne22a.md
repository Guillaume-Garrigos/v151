title: " Faster Unbalanced Optimal Transport: Translation invariant Sinkhorn and 1-D
  Frank-Wolfe "
abstract: ' Unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) extends optimal transport (OT) to take
  into account mass variations when comparing distributions. This is crucial for successful
  ML applications of OT, as it makes it robust to data normalization and outliers.
  The baseline algorithm is Sinkhorn, but its convergence speed might be significantly
  slower for UOT than for OT. In this work, we identify the cause for this deficiency,
  namely the lack of a global normalization of the iterates, which equivalently corresponds
  to a translation of the dual OT potentials. Our first contribution leverages this
  idea to develop an accelerated Sinkhorn algorithm (coined "translation invariant
  Sinkhorn") for UOT, bridging the computational gap with OT. Our second contribution
  focuses on 1-D UOT and proposes a Frank-Wolfe solver applied to this translation
  invariant formulation. The linear oracle of each step amounts to solving a 1-D OT
  problem, resulting in a linear time complexity per iteration. Our last contribution
  extends this method to the computation of UOT barycenter of 1-D measures. Numerical
  simulations showcase the convergence speed improvement brought by these three approaches. '
