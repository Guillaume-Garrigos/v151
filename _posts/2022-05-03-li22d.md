title: " Safe Active Learning for Multi-Output Gaussian Processes "
abstract: " Multi-output regression problems are commonly encountered in science and
  engineering. In particular, multi-output Gaussian processes have been emerged as
  a promising tool for modeling these complex systems since they can exploit the inherent
  correlations and provide reliable uncertainty estimates. In many applications, however,
  acquiring the data is expensive and safety concerns might arise (e.g. robotics,
  engineering). We propose a safe active learning approach for multi-output Gaussian
  process regression. This approach queries the most informative data or output taking
  the relatedness between the regressors and safety constraints into account. We prove
  the effectiveness of our approach by providing theoretical analysis and by demonstrating
  empirical results on simulated datasets and on a real-world engineering dataset.
  On all datasets, our approach shows improved convergence compared to its competitors. "
