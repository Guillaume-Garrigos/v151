title: " Pairwise Supervision Can Provably Elicit a Decision Boundary "
abstract: " Similarity learning is a general problem to elicit useful representations
  by predicting the relationship between a pair of patterns. This problem is related
  to various important preprocessing tasks such as metric learning, kernel learning,
  and contrastive learning. A classifier built upon the representations is expected
  to perform well in downstream classification; however, little theory has been given
  in literature so far and thereby the relationship between similarity and classification
  has remained elusive. Therefore, we tackle a fundamental question: can similarity
  information provably leads a model to perform well in downstream classification?
  In this paper, we reveal that a product-type formulation of similarity learning
  is strongly related to an objective of binary classification. We further show that
  these two different problems are explicitly connected by an excess risk bound. Consequently,
  our results elucidate that similarity learning is capable of solving binary classification
  by directly eliciting a decision boundary. "
