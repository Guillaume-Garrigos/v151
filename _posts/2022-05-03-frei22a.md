title: " Self-training Converts Weak Learners to Strong Learners in Mixture Models "
abstract: " We consider a binary classification problem when the data comes from a
  mixture of two rotationally symmetric distributions satisfying concentration and
  anti-concentration properties enjoyed by log-concave distributions among others.
  We show that there exists a universal constant $C_{\\mathrm{err}}>0$ such that if
  a pseudolabeler $\\beta_{\\mathrm{pl}}$ can achieve classification error at most
  $C_{\\mathrm{err}}$, then for any $\\varepsilon>0$, an iterative self-training algorithm
  initialized at $\\beta_0 := \\beta_{\\mathrm{pl}}$ using pseudolabels $\\hat y =
  \\mathrm{sgn}(⟨\\beta_t, \\xb⟩)$ and using at most $\\tilde O(d/\\varepsilon^2)$
  unlabeled examples suffices to learn the Bayes-optimal classifier up to $\\varepsilon$
  error, where $d$ is the ambient dimension. That is, self-training converts weak
  learners to strong learners using only unlabeled examples. We additionally show
  that by running gradient descent on the logistic loss one can obtain a pseudolabeler
  $\\beta_{\\mathrm{pl}}$ with classification error $C_{\\mathrm{err}}$ using only
  $O(d)$ labeled examples (i.e., independent of $\\varepsilon$). Together our results
  imply that mixture models can be learned to within $\\varepsilon$ of the Bayes-optimal
  accuracy using at most $O(d)$ labeled examples and $\\tilde O(d/\\varepsilon^2)$
  unlabeled examples by way of a semi-supervised self-training algorithm. "
