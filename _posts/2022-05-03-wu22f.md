title: " Adaptive Sampling for Heterogeneous Rank Aggregation from Noisy Pairwise
  Comparisons "
abstract: " In heterogeneous rank aggregation problems, users often exhibit various
  accuracy levels when comparing pairs of items. Thus, a uniform querying strategy
  over users may not be optimal. To address this issue, we propose an elimination-based
  active sampling strategy, which estimates the ranking of items via noisy pairwise
  comparisons from multiple users and improves the usersâ€™ average accuracy by maintaining
  an active set of users. We prove that our algorithm can return the true ranking
  of items with high probability. We also provide a sample complexity bound for the
  proposed algorithm, which outperforms the non-active strategies in the literature
  and close to oracle under mild conditions. Experiments are provided to show the
  empirical advantage of the proposed methods over the state-of-the-art baselines. "
