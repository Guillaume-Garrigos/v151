title: " Triangular Flows for Generative Modeling: Statistical Consistency, Smoothness
  Classes, and Fast Rates "
abstract: " Triangular flows, also known as Knöthe-Rosenblatt measure couplings, comprise
  an important building block of normalizing flow models for generative modeling and
  density estimation, including popular autoregressive flows such as real-valued non-volume
  preserving transformation models (Real NVP). We present statistical guarantees and
  sample complexity bounds for triangular flow statistical models. In particular,
  we establish the statistical consistency and the finite sample convergence rates
  of the minimum Kullback-Leibler divergence statistical estimator of the Knöthe-Rosenblatt
  measure coupling using tools from empirical process theory. Our results highlight
  the anisotropic geometry of function classes at play in triangular flows, shed light
  on optimal coordinate ordering, and lead to statistical guarantees for Jacobian
  flows. We conduct numerical experiments to illustrate the practical implications
  of our theoretical findings. "
