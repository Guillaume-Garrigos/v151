title: " Convergent Working Set Algorithm for Lasso with Non-Convex Sparse Regularizers "
abstract: " Non-convex sparse regularizers are common tools for learning with high-dimensional
  data. For accelerating convergence for Lasso problem involving those regularizers,
  a working set strategy addresses the optimization problem through an iterative algorithm
  by gradually incrementing the number of variables to optimize until the identification
  of the solution support. We propose in this paper the first Lasso working set algorithm
  for non-convex sparse regularizers with convergence guarantees. The algorithm, named
  FireWorks, is based on a non-convex reformulation of a recent duality-based approach
  and leverages on the geometry of the residuals. We provide theoretical guarantees
  showing that convergence is preserved even when the inner solver is inexact, under
  sufficient decay of the error across iterations. Experimental results demonstrate
  strong computational gain when using our working set strategy compared to full problem
  solvers for both block-coordinate descent or a proximal gradient solver. "
