title: " Analysis of a Target-Based Actor-Critic Algorithm with Linear Function Approximation "
abstract: " Actor-critic methods integrating target networks have exhibited a stupendous
  empirical success in deep reinforcement learning. However, a theoretical understanding
  of the use of target networks in actor-critic methods is largely missing in the
  literature. In this paper, we reduce this gap between theory and practice by proposing
  the first theoretical analysis of an online target-based actor-critic algorithm
  with linear function approximation in the discounted reward setting. Our algorithm
  uses three different timescales: one for the actor and two for the critic. Instead
  of using the standard single timescale temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm
  as a critic, we use a two timescales target-based version of TD learning closely
  inspired from practical actor-critic algorithms implementing target networks. First,
  we establish asymptotic convergence results for both the critic and the actor under
  Markovian sampling. Then, we provide a finite-time analysis showing the impact of
  incorporating a target network into actor-critic methods. "
