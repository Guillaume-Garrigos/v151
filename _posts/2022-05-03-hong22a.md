title: " Deep Neyman-Scott Processes "
abstract: " A Neyman-Scott process is a special case of a Cox process. The latent
  and observable stochastic processes are both Poisson processes. We consider a deep
  Neyman-Scott process in this paper, for which the building components of a network
  are all Poisson processes. We develop an efficient posterior sampling via Markov
  chain Monte Carlo and use it for likelihood-based inference. Our method opens up
  room for the inference in sophisticated hierarchical point processes. We show in
  the experiments that more hidden Poisson processes brings better performance for
  likelihood fitting and events types prediction. We also compare our method with
  state-of-the-art models for temporal real-world datasets and demonstrate competitive
  abilities for both data fitting and prediction, using far fewer parameters. "
