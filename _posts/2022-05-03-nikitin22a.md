title: " Non-separable Spatio-temporal Graph Kernels via SPDEs "
abstract: " Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a principled and direct approach for
  inference and learning on graphs. However, the lack of justified graph kernels for
  spatio-temporal modelling has held back their use in graph problems. We leverage
  an explicit link between stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and GPs
  on graphs, introduce a framework for deriving graph kernels via SPDEs, and derive
  non-separable spatio-temporal graph kernels that capture interaction across space
  and time. We formulate the graph kernels for the stochastic heat equation and wave
  equation. We show that by providing novel tools for spatio-temporal GP modelling
  on graphs, we outperform pre-existing graph kernels in real-world applications that
  feature diffusion, oscillation, and other complicated interactions. "
