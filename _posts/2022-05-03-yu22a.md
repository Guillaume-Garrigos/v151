title: " Fast Distributionally Robust Learning with Variance-Reduced Min-Max Optimization "
abstract: " Distributionally robust supervised learning (DRSL) is emerging as a key
  paradigm for building reliable machine learning systems for real-world applications–reflecting
  the need for classifiers and predictive models that are robust to the distribution
  shifts that arise from phenomena such as selection bias or nonstationarity. Existing
  algorithms for solving Wasserstein DRSL— one of the most popular DRSL frameworks
  based around robustness to perturbations in the Wasserstein distance—have serious
  limitations that limit their use in large-scale problems—in particular they involve
  solving complex subproblems and they fail to make use of stochastic gradients. We
  revisit Wasserstein DRSL through the lens of min-max optimization and derive scalable
  and efficiently implementable stochastic extra-gradient algorithms which provably
  achieve faster convergence rates than existing approaches. We demonstrate their
  effectiveness on synthetic and real data when compared to existing DRSL approaches.
  Key to our results is the use of variance reduction and random reshuffling to accelerate
  stochastic min-max optimization, the analysis of which may be of independent interest. "
