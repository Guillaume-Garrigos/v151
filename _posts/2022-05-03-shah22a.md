title: " Finding Valid Adjustments under Non-ignorability with Minimal DAG Knowledge "
abstract: " Treatment effect estimation from observational data is a fundamental problem
  in causal inference. There are two very different schools of thought that have tackled
  this problem. On the one hand, the Pearlian framework commonly assumes structural
  knowledge (provided by an expert) in the form of directed acyclic graphs and provides
  graphical criteria such as the back-door criterion to identify the valid adjustment
  sets. On the other hand, the potential outcomes (PO) framework commonly assumes
  that all the observed features satisfy ignorability (i.e., no hidden confounding),
  which in general is untestable. In prior works that attempted to bridge these frameworks,
  there is an observational criteria to identify an <em>anchor variable</em> and if
  a subset of covariates (not involving the anchor variable) passes a suitable conditional
  independence criteria, then that subset is a valid back-door. Our main result strengthens
  these prior results by showing that under a different expert-driven structural knowledge
  — that one variable is a direct causal parent of the treatment variable — remarkably,
  testing for subsets (not involving the known parent variable) that are valid back-doors
  is <em>equivalent</em> to an invariance test. Importantly, we also cover the non-trivial
  case where the entire set of observed features is not ignorable (generalizing the
  PO framework) without requiring the knowledge of all the parents of the treatment
  variable. Our key technical idea involves generation of a synthetic sub-sampling
  (or environment) variable that is a function of the known parent variable. In addition
  to designing an invariance test, this sub-sampling variable allows us to leverage
  Invariant Risk Minimization, and thus, connects finding valid adjustments (in non-ignorable
  observational settings) to representation learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness
  and tradeoffs of these approaches on a variety of synthetic datasets as well as
  real causal effect estimation benchmarks. "
