title: " Counterfactual Explanation Trees: Transparent and Consistent Actionable Recourse
  with Decision Trees "
abstract: ' Counterfactual Explanation (CE) is a post-hoc explanation method that
  provides a perturbation for altering the prediction result of a classifier. An individual
  can interpret the perturbation as an "action" to obtain the desired decision results.
  Existing CE methods focus on providing an action, which is optimized for a given
  single instance. However, these CE methods do not address the case where we have
  to assign actions to multiple instances simultaneously. In such a case, we need
  a framework of CE that assigns actions to multiple instances in a transparent and
  consistent way. In this study, we propose Counterfactual Explanation Tree (CET)
  that assigns effective actions with decision trees. Due to the properties of decision
  trees, our CET has two advantages: (1) Transparency: the reasons for assigning actions
  are summarized in an interpretable structure, and (2) Consistency: these reasons
  do not conflict with each other. We learn a CET in two steps: (i) compute one effective
  action for multiple instances and (ii) partition the instances to balance the effectiveness
  and interpretability. Numerical experiments and user studies demonstrated the efficacy
  of our CET in comparison with existing methods. '
