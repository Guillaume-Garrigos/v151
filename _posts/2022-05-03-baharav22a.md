title: " Approximate Function Evaluation via Multi-Armed Bandits "
abstract: " We study the problem of estimating the value of a known smooth function
  f at an unknown point $\\mu \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, where each component $\\mu_i$ can
  be sampled via a noisy oracle. Sampling more frequently components of $\\mu$ corresponding
  to directions of the function with larger directional derivatives is more sample-efficient.
  However, as $\\mu$ is unknown, the optimal sampling frequencies are also unknown.
  We design an instance-adaptive algorithm that learns to sample according to the
  importance of each coordinate, and with probability at least $1-\\delta$ returns
  an $\\epsilon$ accurate estimate of $f(\\mu)$. We generalize our algorithm to adapt
  to heteroskedastic noise, and prove asymptotic optimality when f is linear. We corroborate
  our theoretical results with numerical experiments, showing the dramatic gains afforded
  by adaptivity. "
