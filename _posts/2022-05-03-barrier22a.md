title: " A Non-asymptotic Approach to Best-Arm Identification for Gaussian Bandits "
abstract: " We propose a new strategy for best-arm identification with fixed confidence
  of Gaussian variables with bounded means and unit variance. This strategy, called
  Exploration-Biased Sampling, is not only asymptotically optimal: it is to the best
  of our knowledge the first strategy with non-asymptotic bounds that asymptotically
  matches the sample complexity. But the main advantage over other algorithms like
  Track-and-Stop is an improved behavior regarding exploration: Exploration-Biased
  Sampling is biased towards exploration in a subtle but natural way that makes it
  more stable and interpretable. These improvements are allowed by a new analysis
  of the sample complexity optimization problem, which yields a faster numerical resolution
  scheme and several quantitative regularity results that we believe of high independent
  interest. "
