title: " On Coresets for Fair Regression and Individually Fair Clustering "
abstract: " In this paper we present coresets for Fair Regression with Statistical
  Parity (SP) constraints and for Individually Fair Clustering. Due to the fairness
  constraints, the classical coreset definition is not enough for these problems.
  We first define coresets for both the problems. We show that to obtain such coresets,
  it is sufficient to sample points based on the probabilities dependent on combination
  of sensitivity score and a carefully chosen term according to the fairness constraints.
  We give provable guarantees with relative error in preserving the cost and a small
  additive error in preserving fairness constraints for both problems. Since our coresets
  are much smaller in size as compared to $n$, the number of points, they can give
  huge benefits in computational costs (from polynomial to polylogarithmic in $n$),
  especially when $n \\gg d$, where $d$ is the input dimension. We support our theoretical
  claims with experimental evaluations. "
