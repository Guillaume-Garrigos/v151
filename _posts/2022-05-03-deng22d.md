title: " Learning Tensor Representations for Meta-Learning "
abstract: " We introduce a tensor-based model of shared representation for meta-learning
  from a diverse set of tasks. Prior works on learning linear representations for
  meta-learning assume that there is a common shared representation across different
  tasks, and do not consider the additional task-specific observable side information.
  In this work, we model the meta-parameter through an order-$3$ tensor, which can
  adapt to the observed task features of the task. We propose two methods to estimate
  the underlying tensor. The first method solves a tensor regression problem and works
  under natural assumptions on the data generating process. The second method uses
  the method of moments under additional distributional assumptions and has an improved
  sample complexity in terms of the number of tasks. We also focus on the meta-test
  phase, and consider estimating task-specific parameters on a new task. Substituting
  the estimated tensor from the first step allows us estimating the task-specific
  parameters with very few samples of the new task, thereby showing the benefits of
  learning tensor representations for meta-learning. Finally, through simulation and
  several real-world datasets, we evaluate our methods and show that it improves over
  previous linear models of shared representations for meta-learning. "
