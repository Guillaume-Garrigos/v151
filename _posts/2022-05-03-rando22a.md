title: " Ada-BKB: Scalable Gaussian Process Optimization on Continuous Domains by
  Adaptive Discretization "
abstract: " Gaussian process optimization is a successful class of algorithms(e.g.
  GP-UCB) to optimize a black-box function through sequential evaluations. However,
  for functions with continuous domains, Gaussian process optimization has to rely
  on either a fixed discretization of the space, or the solution of a non-convex ptimization
  subproblem at each evaluation. The first approach can negatively affect performance,
  while the second approach requires a heavy computational burden. A third option,
  only recently theoretically studied, is to adaptively discretize the function domain.
  Even though this approach avoids the extra non-convex optimization costs, the overall
  computational complexity is still prohibitive. An algorithm such as GP-UCB has a
  runtime of $O(T^4)$, where $T$ is the number of iterations. In this paper, we introduce
  Ada-BKB (Adaptive Budgeted Kernelized Bandit), a no-regret Gaussian process optimization
  algorithm for functions on continuous domains, that provably runs in $O(T^2 d_\\text{eff}^2)$,
  where $d_\\text{eff}$ is the effective dimension of the explored space, and which
  is typically much smaller than $T$. We corroborate our theoretical findings with
  experiments on synthetic non-convex functions and on the real-world problem of hyper-parameter
  optimization, confirming the good practical performances of the proposed approach. "
