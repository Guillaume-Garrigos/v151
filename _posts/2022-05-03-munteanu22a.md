title: " p-Generalized Probit Regression and Scalable Maximum Likelihood Estimation
  via Sketching and Coresets "
abstract: " We study the $p$-generalized probit regression model, which is a generalized
  linear model for binary responses. It extends the standard probit model by replacing
  its link function, the standard normal cdf, by a $p$-generalized normal distribution
  for $p\\in[1, \\infty)$. The $p$-generalized normal distributions (Subbotin, 1923)
  are of special interest in statistical modeling because they fit much more flexibly
  to data. Their tail behavior can be controlled by choice of the parameter $p$, which
  influences the modelâ€™s sensitivity to outliers. Special cases include the Laplace,
  the Gaussian, and the uniform distributions. We further show how the maximum likelihood
  estimator for $p$-generalized probit regression can be approximated efficiently
  up to a factor of $(1+\\varepsilon)$ on large data by combining sketching techniques
  with importance subsampling to obtain a small data summary called coreset. "
