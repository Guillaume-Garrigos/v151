title: " Multivariate Quantile Function Forecaster "
abstract: " We propose Multivariate Quantile Function Forecaster (MQF2), a global
  probabilistic forecasting method constructed using a multivariate quantile function
  and investigate its application to multi-horizon forecasting. Prior approaches are
  either autoregressive, implicitly capturing the dependency structure across time
  but exhibiting error accumulation with increasing forecast horizons, or multi-horizon
  sequence-to-sequence models, which do not exhibit error accumulation, but also do
  typically not model the dependency structure across time steps. MQF2 combines the
  benefits of both approaches, by directly making predictions in the form of a multivariate
  quantile function, defined as the gradient of a convex function which we parametrize
  using input-convex neural networks. By design, the quantile function is monotone
  with respect to the input quantile levels and hence avoids quantile crossing. We
  provide two options to train MQF2: with energy score or with maximum likelihood.
  Experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets show that our model has
  comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods in terms of single time step
  metrics while capturing the time dependency structure. "
