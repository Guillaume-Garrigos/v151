title: " Generalized Group Testing "
abstract: ' In the problem of classical group testing one aims to identify a small
  subset (of size $d$) diseased individuals/defective items in a large population
  (of size $n$) via a minimal number of suitably-designed group tests on subsets of
  items, where the test outcome is positive iff the given test contains at least one
  defective item. Motivated by physical considerations, we consider a generalized
  setting that includes as special cases multiple other group-testing-like models
  in the literature. In our setting, which subsumes as special cases a variety of
  noiseless and noisy group-testing models in the literature, the test outcome is
  positive with probability $f(x)$, where $x$ is the number of defectives tested in
  a pool, and $f(\cdot)$ is an arbitrary {\it monotonically increasing} (stochastic)
  test function. Our main contributions are as follows. 1. We present a non-adaptive
  scheme that with probability $1-\varepsilon$ identifies all defective items. Our
  scheme requires at most ${\cal O}( H(f) d\log(n/\varepsilon))$ tests, where $H(f)$
  is a suitably defined “sensitivity parameter" of $f(\cdot)$, and is never larger
  than ${\cal O}(d^{1+o(1)})$, but may be substantially smaller for many $f(\cdot)$.
  2. We argue that any non-adaptive group testing scheme needs at least $\Omega (h(f)
  d\log(n/d))$ tests to ensure high reliability recovery. Here $h(f)$ is a suitably
  defined “concentration parameter" of $f(\cdot)$, and $h(f) \in \Omega{(1)}$. 3.
  We prove that our sample-complexity bounds for generalized group testing are information-theoretically
  near-optimal for a variety of sparse-recovery group-testing models in the literature.
  That is, for {\it any} “noisy" test function $f(\cdot)$ (i.e. $0< f(0) < f(d) <1$),
  and for a variety of “(one-sided) noiseless" test functions $f(\cdot)$ (i.e., either
  $f(0)=0$, or $f(d)=1$, or both) studied in the literature we show that $H(f)/h(f)
  \in \Theta(1)$. As a by-product we tightly characterize the heretofore open information-theoretic
  sample-complexity for the well-studied model of threshold group-testing. For general
  (near)-noiseless test functions $f(\cdot)$ we show that $H(f)/h(f) \in {\cal O}(d^{1+o(1)})$.
  We also demonstrate a “natural" test-function $f(\cdot)$ whose sample complexity
  scales “extremally" as $\Theta ( d^2\log(n))$, rather than $\Theta ( d\log(n))$
  as in the case of classical group-testing. Some of our techniques may be of independent
  interest – in particular our achievability requires a delicate saddle-point approximation,
  and our impossibility proof relies on a novel bound relating the mutual information
  of pair of random variables with the mean and variance of a specific function, and
  we derive novel structural results about monotone functions. '
