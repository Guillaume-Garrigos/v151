title: " Iterative Alignment Flows "
abstract: " The unsupervised task of aligning two or more distributions in a shared
  latent space has many applications including fair representations, batch effect
  mitigation, and unsupervised domain adaptation. Existing flow-based approaches estimate
  multiple flows independently, which is equivalent to learning multiple full generative
  models. Other approaches require adversarial learning, which can be computationally
  expensive and challenging to optimize. Thus, we aim to jointly align multiple distributions
  while avoiding adversarial learning. Inspired by efficient alignment algorithms
  from optimal transport (OT) theory for univariate distributions, we develop a simple
  iterative method to build deep and expressive flows. Our method decouples each iteration
  into two subproblems: 1) form a variational approximation of a distribution divergence
  and 2) minimize this variational approximation via closed-form invertible alignment
  maps based on known OT results. Our empirical results give evidence that this iterative
  algorithm achieves competitive distribution alignment at low computational cost
  while being able to naturally handle more than two distributions. "
