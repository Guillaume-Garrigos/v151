title: " Conditional Gradients for the Approximately Vanishing Ideal "
abstract: " The vanishing ideal of a set of points X is the set of polynomials that
  evaluate to 0 over all points x in X and admits an efficient representation by a
  finite set of polynomials called generators. To accommodate the noise in the data
  set, we introduce the Conditional Gradients Approximately Vanishing Ideal algorithm
  (CGAVI) for the construction of the set of generators of the approximately vanishing
  ideal. The constructed set of generators captures polynomial structures in data
  and gives rise to a feature map that can, for example, be used in combination with
  a linear classifier for supervised learning. In CGAVI, we construct the set of generators
  by solving specific instances of (constrained) convex optimization problems with
  the Pairwise Frank-Wolfe algorithm (PFW). Among other things, the constructed generators
  inherit the LASSO generalization bound and not only vanish on the training but also
  on out-sample data. Moreover, CGAVI admits a compact representation of the approximately
  vanishing ideal by constructing few generators with sparse coefficient vectors. "
