title: " A Complete Characterisation of ReLU-Invariant Distributions "
abstract: " We give a complete characterisation of families of probability distributions
  that are invariant under the action of ReLU neural network layers (in the same way
  that the family of Gaussian distributions is invariant to affine linear transformations).
  The need for such families arises during the training of Bayesian networks or the
  analysis of trained neural networks, e.g., in the context of uncertainty quantification
  (UQ) or explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). We prove that no invariant parametrised
  family of distributions can exist unless at least one of the following three restrictions
  holds: First, the network layers have a width of one, which is unreasonable for
  practical neural networks. Second, the probability measures in the family have finite
  support, which basically amounts to sampling distributions. Third, the parametrisation
  of the family is not locally Lipschitz continuous, which excludes all computationally
  feasible families. Finally, we show that these restrictions are individually necessary.
  For each of the three cases we can construct an invariant family exploiting exactly
  one of the restrictions but not the other two. "
