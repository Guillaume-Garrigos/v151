title: " Exploring Image Regions Not Well Encoded by an INN "
abstract: " This paper proposes a method to clarify image regions that are not well
  encoded by an invertible neural network (INN), i.e., image regions that significantly
  decrease the likelihood of the input image. The proposed method can diagnose the
  limitation of the representation capacity of an INN. Given an input image, our method
  extracts image regions, which are not well encoded, by maximizing the likelihood
  of the image. We explicitly model the distribution of not-well-encoded regions.
  A metric is proposed to evaluate the extraction of the not-well-encoded regions.
  Finally, we use the proposed method to analyze several state-of-the-art INNs trained
  on various benchmark datasets. "
