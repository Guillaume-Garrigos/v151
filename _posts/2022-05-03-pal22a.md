title: " On Learning Mixture Models with Sparse Parameters "
abstract: " Mixture models are widely used to fit complex and multimodal datasets.
  In this paper we study mixtures with high dimensional sparse latent parameter vectors
  and consider the problem of support recovery of those vectors. While parameter learning
  in mixture models is well-studied, the sparsity constraint remains relatively unexplored.
  Sparsity of parameter vectors is a natural constraint in variety of settings, and
  support recovery is a major step towards parameter estimation. We provide efficient
  algorithms for support recovery that have a logarithmic sample complexity dependence
  on the dimensionality of the latent space. Our algorithms are quite general, namely
  they are applicable to 1) mixtures of many different canonical distributions including
  Uniform, Poisson, Laplace, Gaussians, etc. 2) Mixtures of linear regressions and
  linear classifiers with Gaussian covariates under different assumptions on the unknown
  parameters. In most of these settings, our results are the first guarantees on this
  problem while in the rest, we provide significant improvements on existing results
  in certain regimes. "
