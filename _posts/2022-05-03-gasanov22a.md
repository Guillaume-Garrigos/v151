title: " FLIX: A Simple and Communication-Efficient Alternative to Local Methods in
  Federated Learning "
abstract: " Federated Learning (FL) is an increasingly popular machine learning paradigm
  in which multiple nodes try to collaboratively learn under privacy, communication
  and multiple heterogeneity constraints. A persistent problem in federated learning
  is that it is not clear what the optimization objective should be: the standard
  average risk minimization of supervised learning is inadequate in handling several
  major constraints specific to federated learning, such as communication adaptivity
  and personalization control. We identify several key desiderata in frameworks for
  federated learning and introduce a new framework, FLIX, that takes into account
  the unique challenges brought by federated learning. FLIX has a standard finite-sum
  form, which enables practitioners to tap into the immense wealth of existing (potentially
  non-local) methods for distributed optimization. Through a smart initialization
  that does not require any communication, FLIX does not require the use of local
  steps but is still provably capable of performing dissimilarity regularization on
  par with local methods. We give several algorithms for solving the FLIX formulation
  efficiently under communication constraints. Finally, we corroborate our theoretical
  results with extensive experimentation. "
