title: " Variational Gaussian Processes: A Functional Analysis View "
abstract: " Variational Gaussian process (GP) approximations have become a standard
  tool in fast GP inference. This technique requires a user to select variational
  features to increase efficiency. So far the common choices in the literature are
  disparate and lacking generality. We propose to view the GP as lying in a Banach
  space which then facilitates a unified perspective. This is used to understand the
  relationship between existing features and to draw a connection between kernel ridge
  regression and variational GP approximations. "
