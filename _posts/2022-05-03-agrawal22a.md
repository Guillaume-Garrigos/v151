title: " Leveraging Time Irreversibility with Order-Contrastive Pre-training "
abstract: ' Label-scarce, high-dimensional domains such as healthcare present a challenge
  for modern machine learning techniques. To overcome the difficulties posed by a
  lack of labeled data, we explore an "order-contrastive" method for self-supervised
  pre-training on longitudinal data. We sample pairs of time segments, switch the
  order for half of them, and train a model to predict whether a given pair is in
  the correct order. Intuitively, the ordering task allows the model to attend to
  the least time-reversible features (for example, features that indicate progression
  of a chronic disease). The same features are often useful for downstream tasks of
  interest. To quantify this, we study a simple theoretical setting where we prove
  a finite-sample guarantee for the downstream error of a representation learned with
  order-contrastive pre-training. Empirically, in synthetic and longitudinal healthcare
  settings, we demonstrate the effectiveness of order-contrastive pre-training in
  the small-data regime over supervised learning and other self-supervised pre-training
  baselines. Our results indicate that pre-training methods designed for particular
  classes of distributions and downstream tasks can improve the performance of self-supervised
  learning. '
