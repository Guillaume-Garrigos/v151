title: " Independent Natural Policy Gradient always converges in Markov Potential
  Games "
abstract: " Natural policy gradient has emerged as one of the most successful algorithms
  for computing optimal policies in challenging Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks,
  yet, very little was known about its convergence properties until recently. The
  picture becomes more blurry when it comes to multi-agent RL (MARL); the line of
  works that have theoretical guarantees for convergence to Nash policies are very
  limited. In this paper, we focus on a particular class of multi-agent stochastic
  games called Markov Potential Games and we prove that Independent Natural Policy
  Gradient always converges using constant learning rates. The proof deviates from
  the existing approaches and the main challenge lies in the fact that Markov potential
  Games do not have unique optimal values (as single-agent settings exhibit) so different
  initializations can lead to different limit point values. We complement our theoretical
  results with experiments that indicate that Natural Policy Gradient outperforms
  Policy Gradient in MARL settings (our process benchmark is multi-state congestion
  games). "
