title: " Unlabeled Data Help: Minimax Analysis and Adversarial Robustness "
abstract: " The recent proposed self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches successfully
  demonstrate the great potential of supplementing learning algorithms with additional
  unlabeled data. However, it is still unclear whether the existing SSL algorithms
  can fully utilize the information of both labelled and unlabeled data. This paper
  gives an affirmative answer for the reconstruction-based SSL algorithm (Lee et al.,
  2020) under several statistical models. While existing literature only focuses on
  establishing the upper bound of the convergence rate, we provide a rigorous minimax
  analysis, and successfully justify the rate-optimality of the reconstruction-based
  SSL algorithm under different data generation models. Furthermore, we incorporate
  the reconstruction-based SSL into the exist- ing adversarial training algorithms
  and show that learning from unlabeled data helps improve the robustness. "
