title: " Learning to Plan Variable Length Sequences of Actions with a Cascading Bandit
  Click Model of User Feedback "
abstract: " Motivated by problems of ranking with partial information, we introduce
  a variant of the cascading bandit model that considers flexible length sequences
  with varying rewards and losses. We formulate two generative models for this problem
  within the generalized linear setting, and design and analyze upper confidence algorithms
  for it. Our analysis delivers tight regret bounds which, when specialized to standard
  cascading bandits, results in sharper guarantees than previously available in the
  literature. We evaluate our algorithms against a representative sample of cascading
  bandit baselines on a number of real-world datasets and show significantly improved
  empirical performance. "
