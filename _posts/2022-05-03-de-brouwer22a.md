title: " Predicting the impact of treatments over time with uncertainty aware neural
  differential equations. "
abstract: " Predicting the impact of treatments from ob- servational data only still
  represents a major challenge despite recent significant advances in time series
  modeling. Treatment assignments are usually correlated with the predictors of the
  response, resulting in a lack of data support for counterfactual predictions and
  therefore in poor quality estimates. Developments in causal inference have lead
  to methods addressing this confounding by requiring a minimum level of overlap.
  However, overlap is difficult to assess and usually not satisfied in practice. In
  this work, we propose Counterfactual ODE (CF-ODE), a novel method to predict the
  impact of treatments continuously over time using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations
  equipped with uncertainty estimates. This allows to specifically assess which treatment
  outcomes can be reliably predicted. We demonstrate over several longitudinal datasets
  that CF-ODE provides more accurate predictions and more reliable uncertainty estimates
  than previously available methods. "
