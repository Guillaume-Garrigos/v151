title: " Learning in Stochastic Monotone Games with Decision-Dependent Data "
abstract: " Learning problems commonly exhibit an interesting feedback mechanism wherein
  the population data reacts to competing decision makersâ€™ actions. This paper formulates
  a new game theoretic framework for this phenomenon, called multi-player performative
  prediction. We establish transparent sufficient conditions for strong monotonicity
  of the game and use them to develop algorithms for finding Nash equilibria. We investigate
  derivative free methods and adaptive gradient algorithms wherein each player alternates
  between learning a parametric description of their distribution and gradient steps
  on the empirical risk. Synthetic and semi-synthetic numerical experiments illustrate
  the results. "
