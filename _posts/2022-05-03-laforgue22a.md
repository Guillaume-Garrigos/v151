title: " A Last Switch Dependent Analysis of Satiation and Seasonality in Bandits "
abstract: " Motivated by the fact that humans like some level of unpredictability
  or novelty, and might therefore get quickly bored when interacting with a stationary
  policy, we introduce a novel non-stationary bandit problem, where the expected reward
  of an arm is fully determined by the time elapsed since the arm last took part in
  a switch of actions. Our model generalizes previous notions of delay-dependent rewards,
  and also relaxes most assumptions on the reward function. This enables the modeling
  of phenomena such as progressive satiation and periodic behaviours. Building upon
  the Combinatorial Semi-Bandits (CSB) framework, we design an algorithm and prove
  a bound on its regret with respect to the optimal non-stationary policy (which is
  NP-hard to compute). Similarly to previous works, our regret analysis is based on
  defining and solving an appropriate trade-off between approximation and estimation.
  Preliminary experiments confirm the superiority of our algorithm over both the oracle
  greedy approach and a vanilla CSB solver. "
