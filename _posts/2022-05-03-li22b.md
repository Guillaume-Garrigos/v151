title: " Deep Multi-Fidelity Active Learning of High-Dimensional Outputs "
abstract: " Many applications, such as in physical simulation and engineering design,
  demand we estimate functions with high-dimensional outputs. To reduce the expensive
  cost of generating training examples, we usually choose several fidelities to enable
  a cost/quality trade-off. In this paper, we consider the active learning task to
  automatically identify the fidelities and training inputs to query new examples
  so as to achieve the best learning benefit-cost ratio. To this end, we propose DMFAL,
  a Deep Multi-Fidelity Active Learning approach. We first develop a deep neural network-based
  multi-fidelity model for high-dimensional outputs, which can flexibly capture strong
  complex correlations across the outputs and fidelities to enhance the learning of
  the target function. We then propose a mutual information based acquisition function
  that extends the predictive entropy principle. To overcome the computational challenges
  caused by large output dimensions, we use the multi-variate delta method and moment-matching
  to estimate the output posterior, and Weinstein-Aronszajn identity to calculate
  and optimize the acquisition function. We show the advantage of our method in several
  applications of computational physics and engineering design. The code is available
