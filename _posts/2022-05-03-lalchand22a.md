title: " Generalised GPLVM with Stochastic Variational Inference "
abstract: " Gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVM) are a flexible and non-linear
  approach to dimensionality reduction, extending classical Gaussian processes to
  an unsupervised learning context. The Bayesian incarnation of the GPLVM uses a variational
  framework, where the posterior over latent variables is approximated by a well-behaved
  variational family, a factorised Gaussian yielding a tractable lower bound. However,
  the non-factorisability of the lower bound prevents truly scalable inference. In
  this work, we study the doubly stochastic formulation of the Bayesian GPLVM model
  amenable with minibatch training. We show how this framework is compatible with
  different latent variable formulations and perform experiments to compare a suite
  of models. Further, we demonstrate how we can train in the presence of massively
  missing data and obtain high-fidelity reconstructions. We demonstrate the modelâ€™s
  performance by benchmarking against the canonical sparse GPLVM for high dimensional
  data examples. "
