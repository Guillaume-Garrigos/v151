title: " Stochastic Extragradient: General Analysis and Improved Rates "
abstract: " The Stochastic Extragradient (SEG) method is one of the most popular algorithms
  for solving min-max optimization and variational inequalities problems (VIP) appearing
  in various machine learning tasks. However, several important questions regarding
  the convergence properties of SEG are still open, including the sampling of stochastic
  gradients, mini-batching, convergence guarantees for the monotone finite-sum variational
  inequalities with possibly non-monotone terms, and others. To address these questions,
  in this paper, we develop a novel theoretical framework that allows us to analyze
  several variants of SEG in a unified manner. Besides standard setups, like Same-Sample
  SEG under Lipschitzness and monotonicity or Independent-Samples SEG under uniformly
  bounded variance, our approach allows us to analyze variants of SEG that were never
  explicitly considered in the literature before. Notably, we analyze SEG with arbitrary
  sampling which includes importance sampling and various mini-batching strategies
  as special cases. Our rates for the new variants of SEG outperform the current state-of-the-art
  convergence guarantees and rely on less restrictive assumptions. "
