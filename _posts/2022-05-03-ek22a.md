title: " Learning Pareto-Efficient Decisions with Confidence "
abstract: " The paper considers the problem of multi-objective decision support when
  outcomes are uncertain. We extend the concept of Pareto-efficient decisions to take
  into account the uncertainty of decision outcomes across varying contexts. This
  enables quantifying trade-offs between decisions in terms of tail outcomes that
  are relevant in safety-critical applications. We propose a method for learning efficient
  decisions with statistical confidence, building on results from the conformal prediction
  literature. The method adapts to weak or nonexistent context covariate overlap and
  its statistical guarantees are evaluated using both synthetic and real data. "
