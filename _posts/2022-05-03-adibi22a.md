title: " Minimax Optimization: The Case of Convex-Submodular "
abstract: " Minimax optimization has been central in addressing various applications
  in machine learning, game theory, and control theory. Prior literature has thus
  far mainly focused on studying such problems in the continuous domain, e.g., convex-concave
  minimax optimization is now understood to a significant extent. Nevertheless, minimax
  problems extend far beyond the continuous domain to mixed continuous-discrete domains
  or even fully discrete domains. In this paper, we study mixed continuous-discrete
  minimax problems where the minimization is over a continuous variable belonging
  to Euclidean space and the maximization is over subsets of a given ground set. We
  introduce the class of convex-submodular minimax problems, where the objective is
  convex with respect to the continuous variable and submodular with respect to the
  discrete variable. Even though such problems appear frequently in machine learning
  applications, little is known about how to address them from algorithmic and theoretical
  perspectives. For such problems, we first show that obtaining saddle points are
  hard up to any approximation, and thus introduce new notions of (near-) optimality.
  We then provide several algorithmic procedures for solving convex and monotone-submodular
  minimax problems and characterize their convergence rates, computational complexity,
  and quality of the final solution according to our notions of optimally. Our proposed
  algorithms are iterative and combine tools from both discrete and continuous optimization.
  Finally, we provide numerical experiments to showcase the effectiveness of our purposed
  methods. "
