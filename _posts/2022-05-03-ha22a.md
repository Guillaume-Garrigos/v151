title: " On Convergence of Lookahead in Smooth Games "
abstract: " A key challenge in smooth games is that there is no general guarantee
  for gradient methods to converge to an equilibrium. Recently, Chavdarova et al.
  (2021) reported a promising empirical observation that Lookahead (Zhang et al.,
  2019) significantly improves GAN training. While promising, few theoretical guarantees
  has been studied for Lookahead in smooth games. In this work, we establish the first
  convergence guarantees of Lookahead for smooth games. We present a spectral analysis
  and provide a geometric explanation of how and when it actually improves the convergence
  around a stationary point. Based on the analysis, we derive sufficient conditions
  for Lookahead to stabilize or accelerate the local convergence in smooth games.
  Our study reveals that Lookahead provides a general mechanism for stabilization
  and acceleration in smooth games. "
