title: " Asynchronous Upper Confidence Bound Algorithms for Federated Linear Bandits "
abstract: " Linear contextual bandit is a popular online learning problem. It has
  been mostly studied in centralized learning settings. With the surging demand of
  large-scale decentralized model learning, e.g., federated learning, how to retain
  regret minimization while reducing communication cost becomes an open challenge.
  In this paper, we study linear contextual bandit in a federated learning setting.
  We propose a general framework with asynchronous model update and communication
  for a collection of homogeneous clients and heterogeneous clients, respectively.
  Rigorous theoretical analysis is provided about the regret and communication cost
  under this distributed learning framework; and extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our solution. "
