title: " Bayesian Inference and Partial Identification in Multi-Treatment Causal Inference
  with Unobserved Confounding "
abstract: " In causal estimation problems, the parameter of interest is often only
  partially identified, implying that the parameter cannot be recovered exactly, even
  with infinite data. Here, we study Bayesian inference for partially identified treatment
  effects in multi-treatment causal inference problems with unobserved confounding.
  In principle, inferring the partially identified treatment effects is natural under
  the Bayesian paradigm, but the results can be highly sensitive to parameterization
  and prior specification, often in surprising ways. It is thus essential to understand
  which aspects of the conclusions about treatment effects are driven entirely by
  the prior specification. We use a so-called transparent parameterization to contextualize
  the effects of more interpretable scientifically motivated prior specifications
  on the multiple effects. We demonstrate our analysis in an example quantifying the
  effects of gene expression levels on mouse obesity. "
