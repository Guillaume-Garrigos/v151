title: " Conditional Linear Regression for Heterogeneous Covariances "
abstract: " Often machine learning and statistical models will attempt to describe
  the majority of the data. However, there may be situations where only a fraction
  of the data can be fit well by a linear regression model. Here, we are interested
  in a case where such inliers can be identified by a Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)
  formula. We give a polynomial time algorithm for the conditional linear regression
  task, which identifies a DNF condition together with the linear predictor on the
  corresponding portion of the data. In this work, we improve on previous algorithms
  by removing a requirement that the covariances of the data satisfying each of the
  terms of the condition have to all be very similar in spectral norm to the covariance
  of the overall condition. "
