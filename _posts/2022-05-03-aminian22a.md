title: " An Information-theoretical Approach to Semi-supervised Learning under Covariate-shift "
abstract: " A common assumption in semi-supervised learning is that the labeled, unlabeled,
  and test data are drawn from the same distribution. However, this assumption is
  not satisfied in many applications. In many scenarios, the data is collected sequentially
  (e.g., healthcare) and the distribution of the data may change over time often exhibiting
  so-called covariate shifts. In this paper, we propose an approach for semi-supervised
  learning algorithms that is capable of addressing this issue. Our framework also
  recovers some popular methods, including entropy minimization and pseudo-labeling.
  We provide new information-theoretical based generalization error upper bounds inspired
  by our novel framework. Our bounds are applicable to both general semi-supervised
  learning and the covariate-shift scenario. Finally, we show numerically that our
  method outperforms previous approaches proposed for semi-supervised learning under
  the covariate shift. "
