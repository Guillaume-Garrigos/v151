title: " Entrywise Recovery Guarantees for Sparse PCA via Sparsistent Algorithms "
abstract: " Sparse Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a prevalent tool across a
  plethora of subfield of applied statistics. While several results have characterized
  the recovery error of the principal eigenvectors, these are typically in spectral
  or Frobenius norms. In this paper, we provide entrywise $\\ell_{2,\\infty}$ bounds
  for Sparse PCA under a general high-dimensional subgaussian design. In particular,
  our bounds hold for any algorithm that selects the correct support with high probability,
  those that are sparsistent. Our bound improves upon known results by providing a
  finer characterization of the estimation error, and our proof uses techniques recently
  developed for entrywise subspace perturbation theory. "
