title: " Nonstationary multi-output Gaussian processes via harmonizable spectral mixtures "
abstract: " Kernel design for Multi-output Gaussian Processes (MOGP) has received
  increased attention recently, in particular, the Multi-Output Spectral Mixture kernel
  (MOSM) approach has been praised as a general model in the sense that it extends
  other approaches such as Linear Model of Corregionalization, Intrinsic Corregionalization
  Model and Cross-Spectral Mixture. MOSM relies on Cramerâ€™s theorem to parametrise
  the power spectral densities (PSD) as a Gaussian mixture, thus, having a structural
  restriction: by assuming the existence of a PSD, the method is only suited for multi-output
  stationary processes. We develop a nonstationary extension of MOSM by proposing
  the family of harmonizable kernels for MOGPs, a class of kernels that contains both
  stationary and a vast majority of non-stationary processes. A main contribution
  of the proposed harmonizable kernels is that they automatically identify a possible
  nonstationary behaviour meaning that practitioners do not need to choose between
  stationary or non-stationary kernels. The proposed method is first validated on
  synthetic data with the purpose of illustrating the key properties of our approach,
  and then compared to existing MOGP methods on two real-world settings from finance
  and electroencephalography. "
