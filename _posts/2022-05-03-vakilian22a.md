title: " Improved Approximation Algorithms for Individually Fair Clustering "
abstract: " We consider the $k$-clustering problem with $\\ell_p$-norm cost, which
  includes $k$-median, $k$-means and $k$-center, under an individual notion of fairness
  proposed by Jung et al. [2020]: given a set of points $P$ of size $n$, a set of
  $k$ centers induces a fair clustering if every point in $P$ has a center among its
  $n/k$ closest neighbors. Mahabadi and Vakilian [2020] presented a $( p^{O(p)},7)$-bicriteria
  approximation for fair clustering with $\\ell_p$-norm cost: every point finds a
  center within distance at most $7$ times its distance to its $(n/k)$-th closest
  neighbor and the $\\ell_p$-norm cost of the solution is at most $p^{O(p)}$ times
  the cost of an optimal fair solution. In this work, for any $\\epsilon>0$, we present
  an improved $(16^p +\\epsilon,3)$-bicriteria for this problem. Moreover, for $p=1$
  ($k$-median) and $p=\\infty$ ($k$-center), we present improved cost-approximation
  factors $7.081+\\epsilon$ and $3+\\epsilon$ respectively. To achieve our guarantees,
  we extend the framework of [Charikar et al.,2002, Swamy, 2016] and devise a $16^p$-approximation
  algorithm for the facility location with $\\ell_p$-norm cost under matroid constraint
  which might be of an independent interest. Besides, our approach suggests a reduction
  from our individually fair clustering to a clustering with a group fairness requirement
  proposed by [Kleindessner et al. 2019], which is essentially the median matroid
  problem. "
