title: " Structured variational inference in Bayesian state-space models "
abstract: " Variational inference is routinely deployed in Bayesian state-space models
  as an efficient computational technique. Motivated by the inconsistency issue observed
  by Wang and Titterington (2004) for the mean-field approximation in linear state-space
  models, we consider a more expressive variational family for approximating the joint
  posterior of the latent variables to retain their dependence, while maintaining
  the mean-field (i.e. independence) structure between latent variables and parameters.
  In state-space models, such a latent structure adapted mean-field approximation
  can be efficiently computed using the belief propagation algorithm. Theoretically,
  we show that this adapted mean-field approximation achieves consistency of the variational
  estimates. Furthermore, we derive a non-asymptotic risk bound for an averaged alpha-divergence
  from the true data generating model, suggesting that the posterior mean of the best
  variational approximation for the static parameters shows optimal concentration.
  From a broader perspective, we add to the growing literature on statistical accuracy
  of variational approximations by allowing dependence between the latent variables,
  and the techniques developed here should be useful in related contexts. "
