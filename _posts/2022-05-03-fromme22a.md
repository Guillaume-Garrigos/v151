title: " ContextGen: Targeted Data Generation for Low Resource Domain Specific Text
  Classification "
abstract: " To address the challenging low-resource non-topical text classification
  problems in domain specific settings we introduce ContextGen â€“ a novel approach
  that uses targeted text generation with no fine tuning to augment the available
  small annotated dataset. It first adapts the powerful GPT-2 text generation model
  to generate samples relevant for the domain by using properly designed context text
  as input for generation. Then it assigns class labels to the newly generated samples
  after which they are added to the initial training set. We demonstrate the superior
  performance of a state-of-the-art text classifier trained with the augmented labelled
  dataset for four different non-topical tasks in the low resource setting, three
  of which are from specialized domains. "
