title: " Parameter-Free Online Linear Optimization with Side Information via Universal
  Coin Betting "
abstract: " A class of parameter-free online linear optimization algorithms is proposed
  that harnesses the structure of an adversarial sequence by adapting to some side
  information. These algorithms combine the reduction technique of Orabona and Pal
  (2016) for adapting coin betting algorithms for online linear optimization with
  universal compression techniques in information theory for incorporating sequential
  side information to coin betting. Concrete examples are studied in which the side
  information has a tree structure and consists of quantized values of the previous
  symbols of the adversarial sequence, including fixed-order and variable-order Markov
  cases. By modifying the context-tree weighting technique of Willems, Shtarkov, and
  Tjalkens (1995), the proposed algorithm is further refined to achieve the best performance
  over all adaptive algorithms with tree-structured side information of a given maximum
  order in a computationally efficient manner. "
