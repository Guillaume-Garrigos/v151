title: " On the Generalization of Representations in Reinforcement Learning "
abstract: " In reinforcement learning, state representations are used to tractably
  deal with large problem spaces. State representations serve both to approximate
  the value function with few parameters, but also to generalize to newly encountered
  states. Their features may be learned implicitly (as part of a neural network) or
  explicitly (for example, the successor representation of Dayan(1993). While the
  approximation properties of representations are reasonably well-understood, a precise
  characterization of how and when these representations generalize is lacking. In
  this work, we address this gap and provide an informative bound on the generalization
  error arising from a specific state representation. This bound is based on the notion
  of effective dimension which measures the degree to which knowing the value at one
  state informs the value at other states. Our bound applies to any state representation
  and quantifies the natural tension between representations that generalize well
  and those that approximate well. We complement our theoretical results with an empirical
  survey of classic representation learning methods from the literature and results
  on the Arcade Learning Environment, and find that the generalization behaviour of
  learned representations is well-explained by their effective dimension. "
