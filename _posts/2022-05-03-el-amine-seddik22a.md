title: " Node Feature Kernels Increase Graph Convolutional Network Robustness "
abstract: " The robustness of the much used Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to
  perturbations of their input is becoming a topic of increasing importance. In this
  paper the random GCN is introduced for which a random matrix theory analysis is
  possible. This analysis suggests that if the graph is sufficiently perturbed, or
  in the extreme case random, then the GCN fails to benefit from the node features.
  It is furthermore observed that enhancing the message passing step in GCNs by adding
  the node feature kernel to the adjacency matrix of the graph structure solves this
  problem. An empirical study of a GCN utilised for node classification on six real
  datasets further confirms the theoretical findings and demonstrates that perturbations
  of the graph structure can result in GCNs performing significantly worse than Multi-Layer
  Perceptrons run on the node features alone. In practice, adding a node feature kernel
  to the message passing of perturbed graphs results in a significant improvement
  of the GCNâ€™s performance, thereby rendering it more robust to graph perturbations.
