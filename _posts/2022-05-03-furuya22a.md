title: " Spectral Pruning for Recurrent Neural Networks "
abstract: ' Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks used in
  sequential tasks. However, in general, RNNs have a large number of parameters and
  involve enormous computational costs by repeating the recurrent structures in many
  time steps. As a method to overcome this difficulty, RNN pruning has attracted increasing
  attention in recent years, and it brings us benefits in terms of the reduction of
  computational cost as the time step progresses. However, most existing methods of
  RNN pruning are heuristic. The purpose of this paper is to study the theoretical
  scheme for RNN pruning method. We propose an appropriate pruning algorithm for RNNs
  inspired by "spectral pruning", and provide the generalization error bounds for
  compressed RNNs. We also provide numerical experiments to demonstrate our theoretical
  results and show the effectiveness of our pruning method compared with the existing
  methods. '
