title: " Aligned Multi-Task Gaussian Process "
abstract: " Multi-task learning requires accurate identification of the correlations
  between tasks. In real-world time-series, tasks are rarely perfectly temporally
  aligned; traditional multi-task models do not account for this and subsequent errors
  in correlation estimation will result in poor predictive performance and uncertainty
  quantification. We introduce a method that automatically accounts for temporal misalignment
  in a unified generative model that improves predictive performance. Our method uses
  Gaussian processes (GPs) to model the correlations both within and between the tasks.
  Building on the previous work by Kazlauskaite et al. (2019), we include a separate
  monotonic warp of the input data to model temporal misalignment. In contrast to
  previous work, we formulate a lower bound that accounts for uncertainty in both
  the estimates of the warping process and the underlying functions. Also, our new
  take on a monotonic stochastic process, with efficient path-wise sampling for the
  warp functions, allows us to perform full Bayesian inference in the model rather
  than MAP estimates. Missing data experiments, on synthetic and real time-series,
  demonstrate the advantages of accounting for misalignments (vs standard unaligned
  method) as well as modelling the uncertainty in the warping process (vs baseline
  MAP alignment approach). "
