title: " Predictive variational Bayesian inference as risk-seeking optimization "
abstract: " Since the Bayesian inference works poorly under model misspecification,
  various solutions have been explored to counteract the shortcomings. Recently proposed
  predictive Bayes (PB) that directly optimizes the Kullback Leibler divergence between
  the empirical distribution and the approximate predictive distribution shows excellent
  performances not only under model misspecification but also for over-parametrized
  models. However, its behavior and superiority are still unclear, which limits the
  applications of PB. Specifically, the superiority of PB has been shown only in terms
  of the predictive test log-likelihood and the performance in the sense of parameter
  estimation has not been investigated yet. Also, it is not clear why PB is superior
  with misspecified and over-parameterized models. In this paper, we clarify these
  ambiguities by studying PB in the framework of risk-seeking optimization. To achieve
  this, first, we provide a consistency theory for PB and then present intuition of
  robustness of PB to model misspecification using a response function theory. Thereafter,
  we theoretically and numerically show that PB has an implicit regularization effect
  that leads to flat local minima in over-parametrized models. "
