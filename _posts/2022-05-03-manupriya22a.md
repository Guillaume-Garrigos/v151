title: " Improving Attribution Methods by Learning Submodular Functions "
abstract: " This work explores the novel idea of learning a submodular scoring function
  to improve the specificity/selectivity of existing feature attribution methods.
  Submodular scores are natural for attribution as they are known to accurately model
  the principle of diminishing returns. A new formulation for learning a deep submodular
  set function that is consistent with the real-valued attribution maps obtained by
  existing attribution methods is proposed. The final attribution value of a feature
  is then defined as the marginal gain in the induced submodular score of the feature
  in the context of other highly attributed features, thus decreasing the attribution
  of redundant yet discriminatory features. Experiments on multiple datasets illustrate
  that the proposed attribution method achieves higher specificity along with good
  discriminative power. The implementation of our method is publicly available at
