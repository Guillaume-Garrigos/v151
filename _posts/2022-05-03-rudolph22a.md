title: " Modeling Conditional Dependencies in Multiagent Trajectories "
abstract: " We study modeling joint densities over sets of random variables (next-step
  movements of multiple agents) which are conditioned on aligned observations (past
  trajectories). For this setting, we propose an autoregressive approach to model
  intra-timestep dependencies, where distributions over joint movements are represented
  by autoregressive factorizations. In our approach, factors are randomly ordered
  and estimated with a graph neural network to account for permutation equivariance,
  while a recurrent neural network encodes past trajectories. We further propose a
  conditional two-stream attention mechanism, to allow for efficient training of random
  factorizations. We experiment on trajectory data from professional soccer matches
  and find that we model low frequency trajectories better than variational approaches. "
