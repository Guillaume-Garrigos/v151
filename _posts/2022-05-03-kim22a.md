title: " Robust Deep Learning from Crowds with Belief Propagation "
abstract: " Crowdsourcing systems enable us to collect large-scale dataset, but inherently
  suffer from noisy labels of low-paid workers. We address the inference and learning
  problems using such a crowdsourced dataset with noise. Due to the nature of sparsity
  in crowdsourcing, it is critical to exploit both probabilistic model to capture
  worker prior and neural network to extract task feature despite risks from wrong
  prior and overfitted feature in practice. We hence establish a neural-powered Bayesian
  framework, from which we devise deepMF and deepBP with different choice of variational
  approximation methods, mean field (MF) and belief propagation (BP), respectively.
  This provides a unified view of existing methods, which are special cases of deepMF
  with different priors. In addition, our empirical study suggests that deepBP is
  a new approach, which is more robust against wrong prior, feature overfitting and
  extreme workers thanks to the more sophisticated BP than MF. "
