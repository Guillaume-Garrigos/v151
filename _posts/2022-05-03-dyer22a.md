title: " Amortised Likelihood-free Inference for Expensive Time-series Simulators
  with Signatured Ratio Estimation "
abstract: " Simulation models of complex dynamics in the natural and social sciences
  commonly lack a tractable likelihood function, rendering traditional likelihood-based
  statistical inference impossible. Recent advances in machine learning have introduced
  novel algorithms for estimating otherwise intractable likelihood functions using
  a likelihood ratio trick based on binary classifiers. Consequently, efficient likelihood
  approximations can be obtained whenever good probabilistic classifiers can be constructed.
  We propose a kernel classifier for sequential data using <em>path signatures</em>
  based on the recently introduced signature kernel. We demonstrate that the representative
  power of signatures yields a highly performant classifier, even in the crucially
  important case where sample numbers are low. In such scenarios, our approach can
  outperform sophisticated neural networks for common posterior inference tasks. "
