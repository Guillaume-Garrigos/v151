title: " The Curse of Passive Data Collection in Batch Reinforcement Learning "
abstract: " In high stake applications, active experimentation may be considered too
  risky and thus data are often collected passively. While in simple cases, such as
  in bandits, passive and active data collection are similarly effective, the price
  of passive sampling can be much higher when collecting data from a system with controlled
  states. The main focus of the current paper is the characterization of this price.
  For example, when learning in episodic finite state-action Markov decision processes
  (MDPs) with $S$ states and $A$ actions, we show that even with the best (but passively
  chosen) logging policy, $\\Omega(A^{\\min(\\rS-1, H)}/\\varepsilon^2)$ episodes
  are necessary (and sufficient) to obtain an $\\epsilon$-optimal policy, where $H$
  is the length of episodes. Note that this shows that the sample complexity blows
  up exponentially compared to the case of active data collection, a result which
  is not unexpected, but, as far as we know, have not been published beforehand and
  perhaps the form of the exact expression is a little surprising. We also extend
  these results in various directions, such as other criteria or learning in the presence
  of function approximation, with similar conclusions. A remarkable feature of our
  result is the sharp characterization of the exponent that appears, which is critical
  for understanding what makes passive learning hard. "
