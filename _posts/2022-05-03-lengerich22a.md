title: " Dropout as a Regularizer of Interaction Effects "
abstract: " We examine Dropout through the perspective of interactions. This view
  provides a symmetry to explain Dropout: given N variables, there are N choose k
  possible sets of k variables to form an interaction (i.e. O(N^k)); conversely, the
  probability an interaction of k variables survives Dropout at rate p is (1-p)^k
  (decaying with k). These rates effectively cancel, and so Dropout regularizes against
  higher-order interactions. We prove this perspective analytically and empirically.
  This perspective of Dropout as a regularizer against interaction effects has several
  practical implications: (1) higher Dropout rates should be used when we need stronger
  regularization against spurious high-order interactions, (2) caution should be exercised
  when interpreting Dropout-based explanations and uncertainty measures, and (3) networks
  trained with Input Dropout are biased estimators. We also compare Dropout to other
  regularizers and find that it is difficult to obtain the same selective pressure
  against high-order interactions with these methods. "
