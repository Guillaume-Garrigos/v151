title: " Heavy-tailed Streaming Statistical Estimation "
abstract: " We consider the task of heavy-tailed statistical estimation given streaming
  $p$-dimensional samples. This could also be viewed as stochastic optimization under
  heavy-tailed distributions, with an additional $O(p)$ space complexity constraint.
  We design a clipped stochastic gradient descent algorithm and provide an improved
  analysis, under a more nuanced condition on the noise of the stochastic gradients,
  which we show is critical when analyzing stochastic optimization problems arising
  from general statistical estimation problems. Our results guarantee convergence
  not just in expectation but with exponential concentration, and moreover does so
  using $O(1)$ batch size. We provide consequences of our results for mean estimation
  and linear regression. Finally, we provide empirical corroboration of our results
  and algorithms via synthetic experiments for mean estimation and linear regression. "
