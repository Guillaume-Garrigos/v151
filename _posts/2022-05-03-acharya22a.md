title: " Robust Training in High Dimensions via Block Coordinate Geometric Median
  Descent "
abstract: " Geometric median (GM) is a classical method in statistics for achieving
  robust estimation of the uncorrupted data; under gross corruption, it achieves the
  optimal breakdown point of 1/2. However, its computational complexity makes it infeasible
  for robustifying stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in high-dimensional optimization
  problems. In this paper, we show that by applying GM to only a judiciously chosen
  block of coordinates at a time and using a memory mechanism, one can retain the
  breakdown point of 1/2 for smooth non-convex problems, with non-asymptotic convergence
  rates comparable to the SGD with GM while resulting in significant speedup in training.
  We further validate the run-time and robustness of our approach empirically on several
  popular deep learning tasks. Code available at: https://github.com/anishacharya/BGMD "
