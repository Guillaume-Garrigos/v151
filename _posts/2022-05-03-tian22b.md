title: " Acceleration in Distributed Optimization under Similarity "
abstract: " We study distributed (strongly convex) optimization problems over a network
  of agents, with no centralized nodes. The loss functions of the agents are assumed
  to be similar, due to statistical data similarity or otherwise. In order to reduce
  the number of communications to reach a solution accuracy, we proposed a preconditioned,
  accelerated distributed method. An $\\varepsilon$-solution is achieved in $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\big(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\beta/\\mu}{1-\\rho}}\\log1/\\varepsilon\\big)$
  number of communications steps, where $\\beta/\\mu$ is the relative condition number
  between the global and local loss functions, and $\\rho$ characterizes the connectivity
  of the network. This rate matches (up to poly-log factors) lower complexity communication
  bounds of distributed gossip-algorithms applied to the class of problems of interest.
  Numerical results show significant communication savings with respect to existing
  accelerated distributed schemes, especially when solving ill-conditioned problems. "
