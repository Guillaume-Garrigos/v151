title: " A Unified View of SDP-based Neural Network Verification through Completely
  Positive Programming "
abstract: " Verifying that input-output relationships of a neural network conform
  to prescribed operational specifications is a key enabler towards deploying these
  networks in safety-critical applications. Semidefinite programming (SDP)-based approaches
  to Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) network verification transcribe this problem into
  an optimization problem, where the accuracy of any such formulation reflects the
  level of fidelity in how the neural network computation is represented, as well
  as the relaxations of intractable constraints. While the literature contains much
  progress on improving the tightness of SDP formulations while maintaining tractability,
  comparatively little work has been devoted to the other extreme, i.e., how to most
  accurately capture the original verification problem before SDP relaxation. In this
  work, we develop an exact, convex formulation of verification as a completely positive
  program (CPP), and provide analysis showing that our formulation is minimalâ€“the
  removal of any constraint fundamentally misrepresents the neural network computation.
  We leverage our formulation to provide a unifying view of existing approaches, and
  give insight into the source of large relaxation gaps observed in some cases. "
