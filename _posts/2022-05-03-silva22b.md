title: " On the Interplay between Information Loss and Operation Loss in Representations
  for Classification "
abstract: " Information-theoretic measures have been widely adopted in the design
  of features for learning and decision problems. Inspired by this, we look at the
  relationship between i) a weak form of information loss in the Shannon sense and
  ii) operational loss in the minimum probability of error (MPE) sense when considering
  a family of lossy continuous representations of an observation. Our first result
  offers a lower bound on a weak form of information loss as a function of its respective
  operation loss when adopting a discrete lossy representation (quantization) instead
  of the original raw observation. From this, our main result shows that a specific
  form of vanishing information loss (a weak notion of asymptotic informational sufficiency)
  implies a vanishing MPE loss (or asymptotic operational sufficiency) when considering
  a family of lossy continuous representations. Our theoretical findings support the
  observation that the selection of feature representations that attempt to capture
  informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning, but this design principle
  is a rather conservative if the intended goal is achieving MPE in classification.
  On this last point, we discuss about studying weak forms of informational sufficiencies
  to achieve operational sufficiency in learning settings. "
