title: " Convergence of online k-means "
abstract: " We prove asymptotic convergence for a general class of k-means algorithms
  performed over streaming data from a distributionâ€“the centers asymptotically converge
  to the set of stationary points of the k-means objective function. To do so, we
  show that online k-means over a distribution can be interpreted as stochastic gradient
  descent with a stochastic learning rate schedule. Then, we prove convergence by
  extending techniques used in optimization literature to handle settings where center-specific
  learning rates may depend on the past trajectory of the centers. "
