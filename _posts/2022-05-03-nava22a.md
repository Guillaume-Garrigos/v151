title: " Diversified Sampling for Batched Bayesian Optimization with Determinantal
  Point Processes "
abstract: " In Bayesian Optimization (BO) we study black-box function optimization
  with noisy point evaluations and Bayesian priors. Convergence of BO can be greatly
  sped up by batching, where multiple evaluations of the black-box function are performed
  in a single round. The main difficulty in this setting is to propose at the same
  time diverse and informative batches of evaluation points. In this work, we introduce
  DPP-Batch Bayesian Optimization (DPP-BBO), a universal framework for inducing batch
  diversity in sampling based BO by leveraging the repulsive properties of Determinantal
  Point Processes (DPP) to naturally diversify the batch sampling procedure. We illustrate
  this framework by formulating DPP-Thompson Sampling (DPP-TS) as a variant of the
  popular Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm and introducing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
  procedure to sample from it. We then prove novel Bayesian simple regret bounds for
  both classical batched TS as well as our counterpart DPP-TS; with the latter bound
  being tighter. Our real-world, as well as synthetic, experiments demonstrate improved
  performance of DPP-BBO over classical batching methods with Gaussian process and
  Cox process models. "
