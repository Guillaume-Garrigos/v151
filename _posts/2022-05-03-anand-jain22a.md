title: " PAC Mode Estimation using PPR Martingale Confidence Sequences "
abstract: ' We consider the problem of correctly identifying the mode of a discrete
  distribution $\mathcal{P}$ with sufficiently high probability by observing a sequence
  of i.i.d. samples drawn from $\mathcal{P}$. This problem reduces to the estimation
  of a single parameter when $\mathcal{P}$ has a support set of size $K = 2$. After
  noting that this special case is handled very well by prior-posterior-ratio (PPR)
  martingale confidence sequences (Waudby-Smith and Ramdas, 2020), we propose a generalisation
  to mode estimation, in which $\mathcal{P}$ may take $K \geq 2$ values. To begin,
  we show that the "one-versus-one" principle to generalise from $K = 2$ to $K \geq
  2$ classes is more efficient than the "one-versus-rest" alternative. We then prove
  that our resulting stopping rule, denoted PPR-1v1, is asymptotically optimal (as
  the mistake probability is taken to 0). PPR-1v1 is simple and computationally light,
  and incurs significantly fewer samples than competitors even in the non-asymptotic
  regime. We demonstrate its gains in two practical applications of sampling: election
  forecasting and verification of smart contracts in blockchains. '
