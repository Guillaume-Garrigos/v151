title: " A New Notion of Individually Fair Clustering: $α$-Equitable $k$-Center "
abstract: " Clustering is a fundamental problem in unsupervised machine learning,
  and due to its numerous societal implications fair variants of it have recently
  received significant attention. In this work we introduce a novel definition of
  individual fairness for clustering problems. Specifically, in our model, each point
  $j$ has a set of other points $\\mathcal{S}_j$ that it perceives as similar to itself,
  and it feels that it is being fairly treated if the quality of service it receives
  in the solution is $\\alpha$-close (in a multiplicative sense, for some given $\\alpha
  \\geq 1$) to that of the points in $\\mathcal{S}_j$. We begin our study by answering
  questions regarding the combinatorial structure of the problem, namely for what
  values of $\\alpha$ the problem is well-defined, and what the behavior of the Price
  of Fairness (PoF) for it is. For the well-defined region of $\\alpha$, we provide
  efficient and easily-implementable approximation algorithms for the $k$-center objective,
  which in certain cases also enjoy bounded-PoF guarantees. We finally complement
  our analysis by an extensive suite of experiments that validates the effectiveness
  of our theoretical results. "
