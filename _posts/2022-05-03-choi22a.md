title: " Density Ratio Estimation via Infinitesimal Classification "
abstract: " Density ratio estimation (DRE) is a fundamental machine learning technique
  for comparing two probability distributions. However, existing methods struggle
  in high-dimensional settings, as it is difficult to accurately compare probability
  distributions based on finite samples. In this work we propose DRE-$\\infty$, a
  divide-and-conquer approach to reduce DRE to a series of easier subproblems. Inspired
  by Monte Carlo methods, we smoothly interpolate between the two distributions via
  an infinite continuum of intermediate bridge distributions. We then estimate the
  instantaneous rate of change of the bridge distributions indexed by time (the “time
  score”)—a quantity defined analogously to data (Stein) scores—with a novel time
  score matching objective. Crucially, the learned time scores can then be integrated
  to compute the desired density ratio. In addition, we show that traditional (Stein)
  scores can be used to obtain integration paths that connect regions of high density
  in both distributions, improving performance in practice. Empirically, we demonstrate
  that our approach performs well on downstream tasks such as mutual information estimation
  and energy-based modeling on complex, high-dimensional datasets. "
