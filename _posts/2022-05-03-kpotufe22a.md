title: " Nuances in Margin Conditions Determine Gains in Active Learning "
abstract: " We consider nonparametric classification with smooth regression functions,
  where it is well known that notions of margin in E[Y|X] determine fast or slow rates
  in both active and passive learning. Here we elucidate a striking distinction between
  the two settings. Namely, we show that some seemingly benign nuances in notions
  of margin - involving the uniqueness of the Bayes classifier, and which have no
  apparent effect on rates in passive learning - determine whether or not any active
  learner can outperform passive learning rates. In particular, for Audibert-Tsybakovâ€™s
  margin condition (allowing general situations with non-unique Bayes classifiers),
  no active learner can gain over passive learning in commonly studied settings where
  the marginal on X is near uniform. Our results thus negate the usual intuition from
  past literature that active rates should improve over passive rates in nonparametric
  settings. "
