title: " Sobolev Transport: A Scalable Metric for Probability Measures with Graph
  Metrics "
abstract: " Optimal transport (OT) is a popular measure to compare probability distributions.
  However, OT suffers a few drawbacks such as (i) a high complexity for computation,
  (ii) indefiniteness which limits its applicability to kernel machines. In this work,
  we consider probability measures supported on a graph metric space and propose a
  novel Sobolev transport metric. We show that the Sobolev transport metric yields
  a <em>closed-form</em> formula for fast computation and it is negative definite.
  We show that the space of probability measures endowed with this transport distance
  is isometric to a bounded convex set in a Euclidean space with a weighted l_p distance.
  We further exploit the negative definiteness of the Sobolev transport to design
  positive-definite kernels, and evaluate their performances against other baselines
  in document classification with word embeddings and in topological data analysis. "
