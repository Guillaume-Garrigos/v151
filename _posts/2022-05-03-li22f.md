title: " Distributionally Robust Structure Learning for Discrete Pairwise Markov Networks "
abstract: " We consider the problem of learning the underlying structure of a general
  discrete pairwise Markov network. Existing approaches that rely on empirical risk
  minimization may perform poorly in settings with noisy or scarce data. To overcome
  these limitations, we propose a computationally efficient and robust learning method
  for this problem with near-optimal sample complexities. Our approach builds upon
  distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and maximum conditional log-likelihood.
  The proposed DRO estimator minimizes the worst-case risk over an ambiguity set of
  adversarial distributions within bounded transport cost or f-divergence of the empirical
  data distribution. We show that the primal minimax learning problem can be efficiently
  solved by leveraging sufficient statistics and greedy maximization in the ostensibly
  intractable dual formulation. Based on DROâ€™s approximation to Lipschitz and variance
  regularization, we derive near-optimal sample complexities matching existing results.
  Extensive empirical evidence with different corruption models corroborates the effectiveness
  of the proposed methods. "
