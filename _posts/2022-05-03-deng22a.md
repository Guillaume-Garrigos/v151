title: " Local SGD Optimizes Overparameterized Neural Networks in Polynomial Time "
abstract: " In this paper we prove that Local (S)GD (or FedAvg) can optimize deep
  neural networks with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function in polynomial
  time. Despite the established convergence theory of Local SGD on optimizing general
  smooth functions in communication-efficient distributed optimization, its convergence
  on non-smooth ReLU networks still eludes full theoretical understanding. The key
  property used in many Local SGD analysis on smooth function is gradient Lipschitzness,
  so that the gradient on local models will not drift far away from that on averaged
  model. However, this decent property does not hold in networks with non-smooth ReLU
  activation function. We show that, even though ReLU network does not admit gradient
  Lipschitzness property, the difference between gradients on local models and average
  model will not change too much, under the dynamics of Local SGD. We validate our
  theoretical results via extensive experiments. This work is the first to show the
  convergence of Local SGD on non-smooth functions, and will shed lights on the optimization
  theory of federated training of deep neural networks. "
