title: " Sketch-and-lift: scalable subsampled semidefinite program for K-means clustering "
abstract: " Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a powerful tool for tackling a wide
  range of computationally hard problems such as clustering. Despite the high accuracy,
  semidefinite programs are often too slow in practice with poor scalability on large
  (or even moderate) datasets. In this paper, we introduce a linear time complexity
  algorithm for approximating an SDP relaxed K-means clustering. The proposed sketch-and-lift
  (SL) approach solves an SDP on a subsampled dataset and then propagates the solution
  to all data points by a nearest-centroid rounding procedure. It is shown that the
  SL approach enjoys a similar exact recovery threshold as the K-means SDP on the
  full dataset, which is known to be information-theoretically tight under the Gaussian
  mixture model. The SL method can be made adaptive with enhanced theoretic properties
  when the cluster sizes are unbalanced. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that
  the statistical accuracy of the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art fast
  clustering algorithms without sacrificing too much computational efficiency, and
  is comparable to the original K-means SDP with substantially reduced runtime. "
