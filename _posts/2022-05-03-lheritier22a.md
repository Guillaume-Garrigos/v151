title: " A Cramér Distance perspective on Quantile Regression based Distributional
  Reinforcement Learning "
abstract: " Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) extends the value-based approach
  by approximating the full distribution over future returns instead of the mean only,
  providing a richer signal that leads to improved performances. Quantile Regression
  (QR)-based methods like QR-DQN project arbitrary distributions into a parametric
  subset of staircase distributions by minimizing the 1-Wasserstein distance. However,
  due to biases in the gradients, the quantile regression loss is used instead for
  training, guaranteeing the same minimizer and enjoying unbiased gradients. Non-crossing
  constraints on the quantiles have been shown to improve the performance of QR-DQN
  for uncertainty-based exploration strategies. The contribution of this work is in
  the setting of fixed quantile levels and is twofold. First, we prove that the Cramer
  distance yields a projection that coincides with the 1-Wasserstein one and that,
  under non-crossing constraints, the squared Cramer and the quantile regression losses
  yield collinear gradients, shedding light on the connection between these important
  elements of DRL. Second, we propose a low complexity algorithm to compute the Cramer
  distance. "
