title: " Crowdsourcing Regression: A Spectral Approach "
abstract: " Merging the predictions of multiple experts is a frequent task. When ground-truth
  response values are available, this merging is often based on the estimated accuracies
  of the experts. In various applications, however, the only available information
  are the expertsâ€™ predictions on unlabeled test data, which do not allow to directly
  estimate their accuracies. Moreover, simple merging schemes such as majority voting
  in classification or the ensemble mean or median in regression, are clearly sub-optimal
  when some experts are more accurate than others. Focusing on regression tasks, in
  this work we propose U-PCR, a framework for unsupervised ensemble regression. Specifically,
  we develop spectral-based methods that under mild assumptions and in the absence
  of ground truth data, are able to estimate the mean squared error of the different
  experts and combine their predictions to a more accurate meta-learner. We provide
  theoretical support for U-PCR as well as empirical evidence for the validity of
  its underlying assumptions. On a variety of regression problems, we illustrate the
  improved accuracy of U-PCR over various unsupervised merging strategies. Finally,
  we also illustrate its applicability to unsupervised multi-class ensemble learning. "
