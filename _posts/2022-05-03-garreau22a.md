title: " How to scale hyperparameters for quickshift image segmentation "
abstract: " Quickshift is a popular algorithm for image segmentation, used as a preprocessing
  step in many applications. Unfortunately, it is quite challenging to understand
  the hyperparametersâ€™ influence on the number and shape of superpixels produced by
  the method. In this paper, we study theoretically a slightly modified version of
  the quickshift algorithm, with a particular emphasis on homogeneous image patches
  with i.i.d. pixel noise and sharp boundaries between such patches. Leveraging this
  analysis, we derive a simple heuristic to scale quickshift hyperparameters with
  respect to the image size, which we check empirically. "
