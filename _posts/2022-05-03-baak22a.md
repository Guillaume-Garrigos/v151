title: " Synthsonic: Fast, Probabilistic modeling and Synthesis of Tabular Data "
abstract: " The creation of realistic, synthetic datasets has several purposes with
  growing demand in recent times, e.g. privacy protection and other cases where real
  data cannot be easily shared. A multitude of primarily neural networks (NNs), e.g.
  Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), or Bayesian
  Network (BN) approaches have been created to tackle this problem, however these
  require extensive compute resources, lack interpretability, and in some instances
  lack replication fidelity as well. We propose a hybrid, probabilistic approach for
  synthesizing pairwise independent tabular data, called Synthsonic. A sequence of
  well-understood, invertible statistical transformations removes first-order correlations,
  then a Bayesian Network jointly models continuous and categorical variables, and
  a calibrated discriminative learner captures the remaining dependencies. Replication
  studies on MITâ€™s SDGym benchmark show marginally or significantly better performance
  than all prior BN-based approaches, while being competitive with NN-based approaches
  (first place in 10 out of 13 benchmark datasets). The computational time required
  to learn the data distribution is at least one order of magnitude lower than the
  NN methods. Furthermore, inspecting intermediate results during the synthetic data
  generation allows easy diagnostics and tailored corrections. We believe the combination
  of out-of-the-box performance, speed and interpretability make this method a significant
  addition to the synthetic data generation "
