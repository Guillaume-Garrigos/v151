title: " Data Appraisal Without Data Sharing "
abstract: " One of the most effective approaches to improving the performance of a
  machine learning model is to procure additional training data. A model owner seeking
  relevant training data from a data owner needs to appraise the data before acquiring
  it. However, without a formal agreement, the data owner does not want to share data.
  The resulting Catch-22 prevents efficient data markets from forming. This paper
  proposes adding a data appraisal stage that requires no data sharing between data
  owners and model owners. Specifically, we use multi-party computation to implement
  an appraisal function computed on private data. The appraised value serves as a
  guide to facilitate data selection and transaction. We propose an efficient data
  appraisal method based on forward influence functions that approximates data value
  through its first-order loss reduction on the current model. The method requires
  no additional hyper-parameters or re-training. We show that in private, forward
  influence functions provide an appealing trade-off between high quality appraisal
  and required computation, in spite of label noise, class imbalance, and missing
  data. Our work seeks to inspire an open market that incentivizes efficient, equitable
  exchange of domain-specific training data. "
