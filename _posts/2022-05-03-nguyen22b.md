title: " Federated Learning with Buffered Asynchronous Aggregation "
abstract: " Scalability and privacy are two critical concerns for cross-device federated
  learning (FL) systems. In this work, we identify that synchronous FL â€“ cannot scale
  efficiently beyond a few hundred clients training in parallel. It leads to diminishing
  returns in model performance and training speed, analogous to large-batch training.
  On the other hand, asynchronous aggregation of client updates in FL (i.e., asynchronous
  FL) alleviates the scalability issue. However, aggregating individual client updates
  is incompatible with Secure Aggregation, which could result in an undesirable level
  of privacy for the system. To address these concerns, we propose a novel buffered
  asynchronous aggregation method, FedBuff, that is agnostic to the choice of optimizer,
  and combines the best properties of synchronous and asynchronous FL. We empirically
  demonstrate that FedBuff is $3.3\\times$ more efficient than synchronous FL and
  up to $2.5\\times$ more efficient than asynchronous FL, while being compatible with
  privacy-preserving technologies such as Secure Aggregation and differential privacy.
  We provide theoretical convergence guarantees in a smooth non-convex setting. Finally,
  we show that under differentially private training, FedBuff can outperform FedAvgM
  at low privacy settings and achieve the same utility for higher privacy settings. "
