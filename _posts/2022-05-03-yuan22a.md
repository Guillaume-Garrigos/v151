title: " A general sample complexity analysis of vanilla policy gradient "
abstract: " We adapt recent tools developed for the analysis of Stochastic Gradient
  Descent (SGD) in non-convex optimization to obtain convergence and sample complexity
  guarantees for the vanilla policy gradient (PG). Our only assumptions are that the
  expected return is smooth w.r.t. the policy parameters, that its $H$-step truncated
  gradient is close to the exact gradient, and a certain ABC assumption. This assumption
  requires the second moment of the estimated gradient to be bounded by $A \\geq 0$
  times the suboptimality gap, $B \\geq 0$ times the norm of the full batch gradient
  and an additive constant $C \\geq 0$, or any combination of aforementioned. We show
  that the ABC assumption is more general than the commonly used assumptions on the
  policy space to prove convergence to a stationary point. We provide a single convergence
  theorem that recovers the $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\epsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity
  of PG. Our results also affords greater flexibility in the choice of hyper parameters
  such as the step size and places no restriction on the batch size $m$, including
  the single trajectory case (i.e., $m=1$). We then instantiate our theorem in different
  settings, where we both recover existing results and obtained improved sample complexity,
  e.g., for convergence to the global optimum for Fisher-non-degenerated parameterized
  policies. "
