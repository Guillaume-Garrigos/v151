title: " PACm-Bayes: Narrowing the Empirical Risk Gap in the Misspecified Bayesian
  Regime "
abstract: ' The Bayesian posterior minimizes the "inferential risk" which itself bounds
  the "predictive risk." This bound is tight when the likelihood and prior are well-specified.
  How-ever since misspecification induces a gap,the Bayesian posterior predictive
  distribution may have poor generalization performance. This work develops a multi-sample
  loss (PAC$^m$) which can close the gap by spanning a trade-off between the two risks.
  The loss is computationally favorable and offers PAC generalization guarantees.
  Empirical study demonstrates improvement to the predictive distribution '
