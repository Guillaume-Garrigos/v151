title: " A Dual Approach to Constrained Markov Decision Processes with Entropy Regularization "
abstract: " We study entropy-regularized constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs)
  under the soft-max parameterization, in which an agent aims to maximize the entropy-regularized
  value function while satisfying constraints on the expected total utility. By leveraging
  the entropy regularization, our theoretical analysis shows that its Lagrangian dual
  function is smooth and the Lagrangian duality gap can be decomposed into the primal
  optimality gap and the constraint violation. Furthermore, we propose an accelerated
  dual-descent method for entropy-regularized CMDPs. We prove that our method achieves
  the global convergence rate $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(1/T)$ for both the optimality
  gap and the constraint violation for entropy-regularized CMDPs. A discussion about
  a linear convergence rate for CMDPs with a single constraint is also provided. "
