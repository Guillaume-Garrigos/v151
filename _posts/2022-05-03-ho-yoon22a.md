title: " Doubly Mixed-Effects Gaussian Process Regression "
abstract: " We address the multi-task Gaussian process (GP) regression problem with
  the goal of decomposing input effects on outputs into components shared across or
  specific to tasks and samples. We propose a family of mixed-effects GPs, including
  doubly and translated mixed-effects GPs, that performs such a decomposition, while
  also modeling the complex task relationships. Instead of the tensor product widely
  used in multi-task GPs, we use the direct sum and Kronecker sum for Cartesian product
  to combine task and sample covariance functions. With this kernel, the overall input
  effects on outputs decompose into four components: fixed effects shared across tasks
  and across samples and random effects specific to each task and to each sample.
  We describe an efficient stochastic variational inference method for our proposed
  models that also significantly reduces the cost of inference for the existing mixed-effects
  GPs. On simulated and real-world data, we demonstrate that our approach provides
  higher test accuracy and interpretable decomposition. "
