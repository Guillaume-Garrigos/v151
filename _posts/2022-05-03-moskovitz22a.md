title: " Towards an Understanding of Default Policies in Multitask Policy Optimization "
abstract: " Much of the recent success of deep reinforcement learning has been driven
  by regularized policy optimization (RPO) algorithms with strong performance across
  multiple domains. In this family of methods, agents are trained to maximize cumulative
  reward while penalizing deviation in behavior from some reference, or default policy.
  In addition to empirical success, there is a strong theoretical foundation for understanding
  RPO methods applied to single tasks, with connections to natural gradient, trust
  region, and variational approaches. However, there is limited formal understanding
  of desirable properties for default policies in the multitask setting, an increasingly
  important domain as the field shifts towards training more generally capable agents.
  Here, we take a first step towards filling this gap by formally linking the quality
  of the default policy to its effect on optimization. Using these results, we then
  derive a principled RPO algorithm for multitask learning with strong performance
  guarantees. "
