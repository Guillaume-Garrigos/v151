title: " Efficient Algorithms for Extreme Bandits "
abstract: " In this paper, we contribute to the Extreme Bandits problem, a variant
  of Multi-Armed Bandits in which the learner seeks to collect the largest possible
  reward. We first study the concentration of the maximum of i.i.d random variables
  under mild assumptions on the tail of the rewards distributions. This analysis motivates
  the introduction of Quantile of Maxima (QoMax). The properties of QoMax are sufficient
  to build an Explore-Then-Commit (ETC) strategy, QoMax-ETC, achieving strong asymptotic
  guarantees despite its simplicity. We then propose and analyze a more adaptive,
  anytime algorithm, QoMax-SDA, which combines QoMax with a subsampling method recently
  introduced by Baudry et al. (2021). Both algorithms are more efficient than existing
  approaches in two senses: (1) they lead to better empirical performance (2) they
  enjoy a significant reduction of the storage and computational cost. "
