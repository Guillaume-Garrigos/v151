title: " Chernoff Sampling for Active Testing and Extension to Active Regression "
abstract: " Active learning can reduce the number of samples needed to perform a hypothesis
  test and to estimate the parameters of a model. In this paper, we revisit the work
  of Chernoff that described an asymptotically optimal algorithm for performing a
  hypothesis test. We obtain a novel sample complexity bound for Chernoffâ€™s algorithm,
  with a non-asymptotic term that characterizes its performance at a fixed confidence
  level. We also develop an extension of Chernoff sampling that can be used to estimate
  the parameters of a wide variety of models and we obtain a non-asymptotic bound
  on the estimation error. We apply our extension of Chernoff sampling to actively
  learn neural network models and to estimate parameters in real-data linear and non-linear
  regression problems, where our approach performs favorably to state-of-the-art methods. "
