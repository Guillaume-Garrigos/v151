title: " The Fast Kernel Transform "
abstract: " Kernel methods are a highly effective and widely used collection of modern
  machine learning algorithms. A fundamental limitation of virtually all such methods
  are computations involving the kernel matrix that naively scale quadratically (e.g.,
  matrix-vector multiplication) or cubically (solving linear systems) with the size
  of the dataset N. We propose the Fast Kernel Transform (FKT), a general algorithm
  to compute matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) for datasets in moderate dimensions
  with quasilinear complexity. Typically, analytically grounded fast multiplication
  methods require specialized development for specific kernels. In contrast, our scheme
  is based on auto-differentiation and automated symbolic computations that leverage
  the analytical structure of the underlying kernel. This allows the FKT to be easily
  applied to a broad class of kernels, including Gaussian, Matern, and Rational Quadratic
  covariance functions and Green’s functions, including those of the Laplace and Helmholtz
  equations. Furthermore, the FKT maintains a high, quantifiable, and controllable
  level of accuracy—properties that many acceleration methods lack. We illustrate
  the efficacy and versatility of the FKT by providing timing and accuracy benchmarks
  with comparisons to adjacent methods, and by applying it to scale the stochastic
  neighborhood embedding (t-SNE) and Gaussian processes to large real-world datasets. "
