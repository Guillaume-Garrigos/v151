title: " Provable Lifelong Learning of Representations "
abstract: " In lifelong learning, tasks (or classes) to be learned arrive sequentially
  over time in arbitrary order. During training, knowledge from previous tasks can
  be captured and transferred to subsequent ones to improve sample efficiency. We
  consider the setting where all target tasks can be represented in the span of a
  small number of unknown linear or nonlinear features of the input data. We propose
  a lifelong learning algorithm that maintains and refines the internal feature representation.
  We prove that for any desired accuracy on all tasks, the dimension of the representation
  remains close to that of the underlying representation. The resulting sample complexity
  improves significantly on existing bounds. In the setting of linear features, our
  algorithm is provably efficient and the sample complexity for input dimension $d$,
  $m$ tasks with $k$ features up to error $\\epsilon$ is $\\tilde{O}(dk^{1.5}/\\epsilon+km/\\epsilon)$.
  We also prove a matching lower bound for any lifelong learning algorithm that uses
  a single task learner as a black box. We complement our analysis with an empirical
  study, including a heuristic lifelong learning algorithm for deep neural networks.
  Our method performs favorably on challenging realistic image datasets compared to
  state-of-the-art continual learning methods. "
