title: " k-Pareto Optimality-Based Sorting with Maximization of Choice "
abstract: " Topological sorting is an important technique in numerous practical applications,
  such as information retrieval, recommender systems, optimization, etc. In this paper,
  we introduce a problem of generalized topological sorting with maximization of choice,
  that is, of choosing a subset of items of a predefined size that contains the maximum
  number of equally preferable options (items) with respect to a dominance relation.
  We formulate this problem in a very abstract form and prove that sorting by k-Pareto
  optimality yields a valid solution. Next, we show that the proposed theory can be
  useful in practice. We apply it during the selection step of genetic optimization
  and demonstrate that the resulting algorithm outperforms existing state-of-the-art
  approaches such as NSGA-II and NSGA-III. We also demonstrate that the provided general
  formulation allows discovering interesting relationships and applying the developed
  theory to different applications. "
