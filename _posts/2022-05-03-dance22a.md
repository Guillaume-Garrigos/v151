title: " Fast and Scalable Spike and Slab Variable Selection in High-Dimensional Gaussian
  Processes "
abstract: " Variable selection in Gaussian processes (GPs) is typically undertaken
  by thresholding the inverse lengthscales of automatic relevance determination kernels,
  but in high-dimensional datasets this approach can be unreliable. A more probabilistically
  principled alternative is to use spike and slab priors and infer a posterior probability
  of variable inclusion. However, existing implementations in GPs are very costly
  to run in both high-dimensional and large-n datasets, or are only suitable for unsupervised
  settings with specific kernels. As such, we develop a fast and scalable variational
  inference algorithm for the spike and slab GP that is tractable with arbitrary differentiable
  kernels. We improve our algorithmâ€™s ability to adapt to the sparsity of relevant
  variables by Bayesian model averaging over hyperparameters, and achieve substantial
  speed ups using zero temperature posterior restrictions, dropout pruning and nearest
  neighbour minibatching. In experiments our method consistently outperforms vanilla
  and sparse variational GPs whilst retaining similar runtimes (even when n=10^6)
  and performs competitively with a spike and slab GP using MCMC but runs up to 1000
  times faster. "
