title: " Uncertainty Quantification for Low-Rank Matrix Completion with Heterogeneous
  and Sub-Exponential Noise "
abstract: " The problem of low-rank matrix completion with heterogeneous and sub-exponential
  (as opposed to homogeneous Gaussian) noise is particularly relevant to a number
  of applications in modern commerce. Examples include panel sales data and data collected
  from web-commerce systems such as recommendation engines. An important unresolved
  question for this problem is characterizing the distribution of estimated matrix
  entries under common low-rank estimators. Such a characterization is essential to
  any application that requires quantification of uncertainty in these estimates and
  has heretofore only been available under the assumption of homogenous Gaussian noise.
  Here we characterize the distribution of estimated matrix entries when the observation
  noise is heterogeneous sub-Exponential and provide, as an application, explicit
  formulas for this distribution when observed entries are Poisson or Binary distributed. "
