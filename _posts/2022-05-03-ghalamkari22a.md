title: " Fast Rank-1 NMF for Missing Data with KL Divergence "
abstract: " We propose a fast non-gradient-based method of rank-1 non-negative matrix
  factorization (NMF) for missing data, called A1GM, that minimizes the KL divergence
  from an input matrix to the reconstructed rank-1 matrix. Our method is based on
  our new finding of an analytical closed-formula of the best rank-1 non-negative
  multiple matrix factorization (NMMF), a variety of NMF. NMMF is known to exactly
  solve NMF for missing data if positions of missing values satisfy a certain condition,
  and A1GM transforms a given matrix so that the analytical solution to NMMF can be
  applied. We empirically show that A1GM is more efficient than a gradient method
  with competitive reconstruction errors. "
