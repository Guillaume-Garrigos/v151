title: " Variance Minimization in the Wasserstein Space for Invariant Causal Prediction "
abstract: " Selecting powerful predictors for an outcome is a cornerstone task for
  machine learning. However, some types of questions can only be answered by identifying
  the predictors that causally affect the outcome. A recent approach to this causal
  inference problem leverages the invariance property of a causal mechanism across
  differing experimental environments (Peters et al., 2016; Heinze-Deml et al., 2018).
  This method, invariant causal prediction (ICP), has a substantial computational
  defect – the runtime scales exponentially with the number of possible causal variables.
  In this work, we show that the approach taken in ICP may be reformulated as a series
  of nonparametric tests that scales linearly in the number of predictors. Each of
  these tests relies on the minimization of a novel loss function – the Wasserstein
  variance – that is derived from tools in optimal transport theory and is used to
  quantify distributional variability across environments. We prove under mild assumptions
  that our method is able to recover the set of identifiable direct causes, and we
  demonstrate in our experiments that it is competitive with other benchmark causal
  discovery algorithms. "
