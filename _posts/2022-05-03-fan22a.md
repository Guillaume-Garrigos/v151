title: " On the complexity of the optimal transport problem with graph-structured
  cost "
abstract: " Multi-marginal optimal transport (MOT) is a generalization of optimal
  transport to multiple marginals. Optimal transport has evolved into an important
  tool in many machine learning applications, and its multi-marginal extension opens
  up for addressing new challenges in the field of machine learning. However, the
  usage of MOT has been largely impeded by its computational complexity which scales
  exponentially in the number of marginals. Fortunately, in many applications, such
  as barycenter or interpolation problems, the cost function adheres to structures,
  which has recently been exploited for developing efficient computational methods.
  In this work we derive computational bounds for these methods. In particular, with
  $m$ marginal distributions supported on $n$ points, we provide a $ \\mathcal{\\tilde
  O}(d(\\mathcal{T})m n^{w(G)+1}\\epsilon^{-2})$ bound for a $\\epsilon$-accuracy
  when the problem is associated with a graph that can be factored as a junction tree
  with diameter $d(\\mathcal{T})$ and tree-width $w(G)$. For the special case of the
  Wasserstein barycenter problem, which corresponds to a star-shaped tree, our bound
  is in alignment with the existing complexity bound for it. "
