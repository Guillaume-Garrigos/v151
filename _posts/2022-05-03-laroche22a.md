title: " Beyond the Policy Gradient Theorem for Efficient Policy Updates in Actor-Critic
  Algorithms "
abstract: " In Reinforcement Learning, the optimal action at a given state is dependent
  on policy decisions at subsequent states. As a consequence, the learning targets
  evolve with time and the policy optimization process must be efficient at unlearning
  what it previously learnt. In this paper, we discover that the policy gradient theorem
  prescribes policy updates that are slow to unlearn because of their structural symmetry
  with respect to the value target. To increase the unlearning speed, we study a novel
  policy update: the gradient of the cross-entropy loss with respect to the action
  maximizing $q$, but find that such updates may lead to a decrease in value. Consequently,
  we introduce a modified policy update devoid of that flaw, and prove its guarantees
  of convergence to global optimality in $\\mathcal{O}(t^{-1})$ under classic assumptions.
  Further, we assess standard policy updates and our cross-entropy policy updates
  along six analytical dimensions. Finally, we empirically validate our theoretical
  findings. "
