title: " Meta Learning MDPs with linear transition models "
abstract: " We study meta-learning in Markov Decision Processes (MDP) with linear
  transition models in the undiscounted episodic setting. Under a task sharedness
  metric based on model proximity we study task families characterized by a distribution
  over models specified by a bias term and a variance component. We then propose BUC-MatrixRL,
  a version of the UC-Matrix RL algorithm and show it can meaningfully leverage a
  set of sampled training tasks to quickly solve a test task sampled from the same
  task distribution by learning an estimator of the bias parameter of the task distribution.
  The analysis leverages and extends results in the learning to learn linear regression
  and linear bandit setting to the more general case of MDP’s with linear transition
  models. We prove that compared to learning the tasks in isolation, BUC-Matrix RL
  provides significant improvements in the transfer regret for high bias low variance
  task distributions. "
