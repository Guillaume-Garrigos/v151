title: " Proximal Optimal Transport Modeling of Population Dynamics "
abstract: " We propose a new approach to model the collective dynamics of a population
  of particles evolving with time. As is often the case in challenging scientific
  applications, notably single-cell genomics, measuring features for these particles
  requires destroying them. As a result, the population can only be monitored with
  periodic snapshots, obtained by sampling a few particles that are sacrificed in
  exchange for measurements. Given only access to these snapshots, can we reconstruct
  likely individual trajectories for all other particles? We propose to model these
  trajectories as collective realizations of a causal Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO)
  flow of measures: The JKO scheme posits that the new configuration taken by a population
  at time t+1 is one that trades off an improvement, in the sense that it decreases
  an energy, while remaining close (in Wasserstein distance) to the previous configuration
  observed at t. In order to learn such an energy using only snapshots, we propose
  JKOnet, a neural architecture that computes (in end-to-end differentiable fashion)
  the JKO flow given a parametric energy and initial configuration of points. We demonstrate
  the good performance and robustness of the JKOnet fitting procedure, compared to
  a more direct forward method. "
