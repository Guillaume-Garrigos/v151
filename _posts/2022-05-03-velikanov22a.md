title: " Embedded Ensembles: infinite width limit and operating regimes "
abstract: ' A memory efficient approach to ensembling neural networks is to share
  most weights among the ensembled models by means of a single reference network.
  We refer to this strategy as <span class="emphasized">Embedded Ensembling</span>
  (EE); its particular examples are BatchEnsembles and Monte-Carlo dropout ensembles.
  In this paper we perform a systematic theoretical and empirical analysis of embedded
  ensembles with different number of models. Theoretically, we use a Neural-Tangent-Kernel-based
  approach to derive the wide network limit of the gradient descent dynamics. In this
  limit, we identify two ensemble regimes - <span class="emphasized">independent</span>
  and <span class="emphasized">collective</span> - depending on the architecture and
  initialization strategy of ensemble models. We prove that in the independent regime
  the embedded ensemble behaves as an ensemble of independent models. We confirm our
  theoretical prediction with a wide range of experiments with finite networks, and
  further study empirically various effects such as transition between the two regimes,
  scaling of ensemble performance with the network width and number of models, and
  dependence of performance on a number of architecture and hyperparameter choices. '
