title: " Multiway Spherical Clustering via Degree-Corrected Tensor Block Models "
abstract: " We consider the problem of multiway clustering in the presence of unknown
  degree heterogeneity. Such data problems arise commonly in applications such as
  recommendation system, neuroimaging, community detection, and hypergraph partitions
  in social networks. The allowance of degree heterogeneity provides great flexibility
  in clustering models, but the extra complexity poses significant challenges in both
  statistics and computation. Here, we develop a degree-corrected tensor block model
  with estimation accuracy guarantees. We present the phase transition of clustering
  performance based on the notion of angle separability, and we characterize three
  signal-to-noise regimes corresponding to different statistical-computational behaviors.
  In particular, we demonstrate that an intrinsic statistical-to-computational gap
  emerges only for tensors of order three or greater. Further, we develop an efficient
  polynomial-time algorithm that provably achieves exact clustering under mild signal
  conditions. The efficacy of our procedure is demonstrated through both simulations
  and analyses of Peru Legislation dataset. "
