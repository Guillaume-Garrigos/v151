title: " Vanishing Curvature in Randomly Initialized Deep ReLU Networks "
abstract: " Deep ReLU networks are at the basis of many modern neural architectures.
  Yet, the loss landscape of such networks and its interaction with state-of-the-art
  optimizers is not fully understood. One of the most crucial aspects is the landscape
  at random initialization, which often influences convergence speed dramatically.
  In their seminal works, Xavier & Bengio, 2010 and He et al., 2015 propose an initialization
  strategy that is supposed to prevent gradients from vanishing. Yet, we identify
  some shortcomings of their expectation analysis as network depth increases, and
  show that the proposed initialization can actually fail to deliver stable gradient
  norms. More precisely, by leveraging an in-depth analysis of the median of the forward
  pass, we first show that, with high probability, vanishing gradients cannot be circumvented
  when the network width scales with less than O(depth). Second, we extend this analysis
  to second-order derivatives and show that random i.i.d. initialization also gives
  rise to Hessian matrices with eigenspectra that vanish as networks grow in depth.
  Whenever this happens, optimizers are initialized in a very flat, saddle point-like
  plateau, which is particularly hard to escape with stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
  as its escaping time is inversely related to curvature magnitudes. We believe that
  this observation is crucial for fully understanding (a) the historical difficulties
  of training deep nets with vanilla SGD and (b) the success of adaptive gradient
  methods, which naturally adapt to curvature and thus quickly escape flat plateaus. "
