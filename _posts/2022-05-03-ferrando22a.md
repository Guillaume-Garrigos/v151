title: " Parametric Bootstrap for Differentially Private Confidence Intervals "
abstract: ' The goal of this paper is to develop a practical and general-purpose approach
  to construct confidence intervals for differentially private parametric estimation.
  We find that the parametric bootstrap is a simple and effective solution. It cleanly
  reasons about variability of both the data sample and the randomized privacy mechanism
  and applies "out of the box" to a wide class of private estimation routines. It
  can also help correct bias caused by clipping data to limit sensitivity. We prove
  that the parametric bootstrap gives consistent confidence intervals in two broadly
  relevant settings, including a novel adaptation to linear regression that avoids
  accessing the covariate data multiple times. We demonstrate its effectiveness for
  a variety of estimators, and find empirically that it provides confidence intervals
  with good coverage even at modest sample sizes and performs better than alternative
  approaches. '
