title: " Obtaining Causal Information by Merging Datasets with MAXENT "
abstract: ' The investigation of the question "which treatment has a causal effect
  on a target variable?" is of particular relevance in a large number of scientific
  disciplines. This challenging task becomes even more difficult if not all treatment
  variables were or even can not be observed jointly with the target variable. In
  this paper, we discuss how causal knowledge can be obtained without having observed
  all variables jointly, but by merging the statistical information from different
  datasets. We show how the maximum entropy principle can be used to identify edges
  among random variables when assuming causal sufficiency and an extended version
  of faithfulness, and when only subsets of the variables have been observed jointly. '
