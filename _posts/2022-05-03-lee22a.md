title: " System-Agnostic Meta-Learning for MDP-based Dynamic Scheduling via Descriptive
  Policy "
abstract: " Dynamic scheduling is an important problem in applications from queuing
  to wireless networks. It addresses how to choose an item among multiple scheduling
  items in each timestep to achieve a long-term goal. Most of the conventional approaches
  for dynamic scheduling find the optimal policy for a given specific system so that
  the policy from these approaches is usable only for the corresponding system characteristics.
  Hence, it is hard to use such approaches for a practical system in which system
  characteristics dynamically change. This paper proposes a novel policy structure
  for MDP-based dynamic scheduling, a descriptive policy, which has a system-agnostic
  capability to adapt to unseen system characteristics for an identical task (dynamic
  scheduling). To this end, the descriptive policy learns a system-agnostic scheduling
  principle–in a nutshell, “which condition of items should have a higher priority
  in scheduling”. The scheduling principle can be applied to any system so that the
  descriptive policy learned in one system can be used for another system. Experiments
  with simple explanatory and realistic application scenarios demonstrate that it
  enables system-agnostic meta-learning with very little performance degradation. "
