title: " Federated Myopic Community Detection with One-shot Communication "
abstract: " In this paper, we study the problem of recovering the community structure
  of a network under federated myopic learning. Under this paradigm, we have several
  clients, each of them having a myopic view, i.e., observing a small subgraph of
  the network. Each client sends a censored evidence graph to a central server. We
  provide an efficient algorithm, which computes a consensus signed weighted graph
  from clients evidence, and recovers the underlying network structure in the central
  server. We analyze the topological structure conditions of the network, as well
  as the signal and noise levels of the clients that allow for recovery of the network
  structure. Our analysis shows that exact recovery is possible and can be achieved
  in polynomial time. In addition, our experiments show that in an extremely sparse
  network with 10000 nodes, our method can achieve exact recovery of the community
  structure even if every client has access to only 20 nodes. We also provide information-theoretic
  limits for the central server to recover the network structure from any single client
  evidence. Finally, as a byproduct of our analysis, we provide a novel Cheeger-type
  inequality for general signed weighted graphs. "
