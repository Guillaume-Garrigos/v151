title: " Preference Exploration for Efficient Bayesian Optimization with Multiple
  Outcomes "
abstract: " We consider Bayesian optimization of expensive-to-evaluate experiments
  that generate vector-valued outcomes over which a decision-maker (DM) has preferences.
  These preferences are encoded by a utility function that is not known in closed
  form but can be estimated by asking the DM to express preferences over pairs of
  outcome vectors. To address this problem, we develop Bayesian optimization with
  preference exploration, a novel framework that alternates between interactive real-time
  preference learning with the DM via pairwise comparisons between outcomes, and Bayesian
  optimization with a learned compositional model of DM utility and outcomes. Within
  this framework, we propose preference exploration strategies specifically designed
  for this task, and demonstrate their performance via extensive simulation studies. "
