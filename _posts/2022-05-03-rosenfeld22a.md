title: " An Online Learning Approach to Interpolation and Extrapolation in Domain
  Generalization "
abstract: ' A popular assumption for out-of-distribution generalization is that the
  training data comprises sub-datasets, each drawn from a distinct distribution; the
  goal is then to "interpolate" these distributions and "extrapolate" beyond them—this
  objective is broadly known as domain generalization. A common belief is that ERM
  can interpolate but not extrapolate and that the latter task is considerably more
  difficult, but these claims are vague and lack formal justification. In this work,
  we recast generalization over sub-groups as an online game between a player minimizing
  risk and an adversary presenting new test distributions. Under an existing notion
  of inter- and extrapolation based on reweighting of sub-group likelihoods, we rigorously
  demonstrate that extrapolation is computationally much harder than interpolation,
  though their statistical complexity is not significantly different. Furthermore,
  we show that ERM—possibly with added structured noise—is provably minimax-optimal
  for both tasks. Our framework presents a new avenue for the formal analysis of domain
  generalization algorithms which may be of independent interest. '
