title: " Sharp Bounds for Federated Averaging (Local SGD) and Continuous Perspective "
abstract: " Federated Averaging (FedAvg), also known as Local SGD, is one of the most
  popular algorithms in Federated Learning (FL). Despite its simplicity and popularity,
  the convergence rate of FedAvg has thus far been undetermined. Even under the simplest
  assumptions (convex, smooth, homogeneous, and bounded covariance), the best-known
  upper and lower bounds do not match, and it is not clear whether the existing analysis
  captures the capacity of the algorithm. In this work, we first resolve this question
  by providing a lower bound for FedAvg that matches the existing upper bound, which
  shows the existing FedAvg upper bound analysis is not improvable. Additionally,
  we establish a lower bound in a heterogeneous setting that nearly matches the existing
  upper bound. While our lower bounds show the limitations of FedAvg, under an additional
  assumption of third-order smoothness, we prove more optimistic state-of-the-art
  convergence results in both convex and non-convex settings. Our analysis stems from
  a notion we call iterate bias, which is defined by the deviation of the expectation
  of the SGD trajectory from the noiseless gradient descent trajectory with the same
  initialization. We prove novel sharp bounds on this quantity, and show intuitively
  how to analyze this quantity from a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) perspective. "
