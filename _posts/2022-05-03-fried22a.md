title: " Identity Testing of Reversible Markov Chains "
abstract: " We consider the problem of identity testing of Markov chain transition
  matrices based on a single trajectory of observations under the distance notion
  introduced by Daskalakis et al. (2018a) and further analyzed by Cherapanamjeri and
  Bartlett (2019). Both works made the restrictive assumption that the Markov chains
  under consideration are symmetric. In this work we relax the symmetry assumption
  and show that it is possible to perform identity testing under the much weaker assumption
  of reversibility, provided that the stationary distributions of the reference and
  of the unknown Markov chains are close under a distance notion related to the separation
  distance. Additionally, we provide intuition on the distance notion of Daskalakis
  et al. (2018a) by showing how it behaves under several natural operations. In particular,
  we address some of their open questions. "
