title: " Near-Optimal Task Selection for Meta-Learning with Mutual Information and
  Online Variational Bayesian Unlearning "
abstract: " This paper addresses the problem of active task selection which involves
  selecting the most informative tasks for meta-learning. We propose a novel active
  task selection criterion based on the mutual information between latent task vectors.
  Unfortunately, such a criterion scales poorly in the number of candidate tasks when
  optimized. To resolve this issue, we exploit the submodularity property of our new
  criterion for devising the first active task selection algorithm for meta-learning
  with a near-optimal performance guarantee. To further improve our efficiency, we
  propose an online variant of the Stein variational gradient descent to perform fast
  belief updates of the meta-parameters via maintaining a set of forward (and backward)
  particles when learning (or unlearning) from each selected task. We empirically
  demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithm on real-world datasets. "
