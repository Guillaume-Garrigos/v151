title: " Polynomial Time Reinforcement Learning in Factored State MDPs with Linear
  Value Functions "
abstract: ' Many reinforcement learning (RL) environments in practice feature enormous
  state spaces that may be described compactly by a "factored" structure, that may
  be modeled by Factored Markov Decision Processes (FMDPs). We present the first polynomial
  time algorithm for RL in Factored State MDPs (generalizing FMDPs) that neither relies
  on an oracle planner nor requires a linear transition model; it only requires a
  linear value function with a suitable local basis with respect to the factorization,
  permitting efficient variable elimination. With this assumption, we can solve this
  family of Factored State MDPs in polynomial time by constructing an efficient separation
  oracle for convex optimization. Importantly, and in contrast to prior work on FMDPs,
  we do not assume that the transitions on various factors are conditionally independent. '
