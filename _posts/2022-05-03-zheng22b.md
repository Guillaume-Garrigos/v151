title: " Dual-Level Adaptive Information Filtering for Interactive Image Segmentation "
abstract: " Image segmentation can be performed interactively by accepting user annotations
  to refine the segmentation. It seeks frequent feedback from humans, and the model
  is updated with a smaller batch of data in each iteration of the feedback loop.
  Such a training paradigm requires effective information filtering to guide the model
  so that it can encode vital information and avoid overfitting due to limited data
  and inherent heterogeneity and noises thereof. We propose an adaptive interactive
  segmentation framework to support user interaction while introducing dual-level
  information filtering to train a robust model. The framework integrates an encoder-decoder
  architecture with a style-aware augmentation module that applies augmentation to
  feature maps and customizes the segmentation prediction for different latent styles.
  It also applies a systematic label softening strategy to generate uncertainty-aware
  soft labels for model updates. Experiments on both medical and natural image segmentation
  tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. "
