title: " Learning Revenue-Maximizing Auctions With Differentiable Matching "
abstract: " We propose a new architecture to approximately learn incentive compatible,
  revenue-maximizing auctions from sampled valuations. Our architecture uses the Sinkhorn
  algorithm to perform a differentiable bipartite matching which allows the network
  to learn strategyproof revenue-maximizing mechanisms in settings not learnable by
  the previous RegretNet architecture. In particular, our architecture is able to
  learn mechanisms in settings without free disposal where each bidder must be allocated
  exactly some number of items. In experiments, we show our approach successfully
  recovers multiple known optimal mechanisms and high-revenue, low-regret mechanisms
  in larger settings where the optimal mechanism is unknown. "
