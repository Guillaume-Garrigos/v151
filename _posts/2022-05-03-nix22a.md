title: " Can Functional Transfer Methods Capture Simple Inductive Biases? "
abstract: " Transferring knowledge embedded in trained neural networks is a core problem
  in areas like model compression and continual learning. Among knowledge transfer
  approaches, functional transfer methods such as knowledge distillation and representational
  distance learning are particularly promising, since they allow for transferring
  knowledge across different architectures and tasks. Considering various characteristics
  of networks that are desirable to transfer, equivariance is a notable property that
  enables a network to capture valuable relationships in the data. We assess existing
  functional transfer methods on their ability to transfer equivariance and empirically
  show that they fail to even transfer shift equivariance, one of the simplest equivariances.
  Further theoretical analysis demonstrates that representational similarity methods,
  in fact, cannot guarantee the transfer of the intended equivariance. Motivated by
  these findings, we develop a novel transfer method that learns an equivariance model
  from a given teacher network and encourages the student network to acquire the same
  equivariance, via regularization. Experiments show that our method successfully
  transfers equivariance even in cases where highly restrictive methods, such as directly
  matching student and teacher representations, fail. "
