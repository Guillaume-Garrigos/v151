title: " Projection Predictive Inference for Generalized Linear and Additive Multilevel
  Models "
abstract: " Projection predictive inference is a decision theoretic Bayesian approach
  that decouples model estimation from decision making. Given a reference model previously
  built including all variables present in the data, projection predictive inference
  projects its posterior onto a constrained space of a subset of variables. Variable
  selection is then performed by sequentially adding relevant variables until predictive
  performance is satisfactory. Previously, projection predictive inference has been
  demonstrated only for generalized linear models (GLMs) and Gaussian processes (GPs)
  where it showed superior performance to competing variable selection procedures.
  In this work, we extend projection predictive inference to support variable and
  structure selection for generalized linear multilevel models (GLMMs) and generalized
  additive multilevel models (GAMMs). Our simulative and real-world experiments demonstrate
  that our method can drastically reduce the model complexity required to reach reference
  predictive performance and achieve good frequency properties. "
