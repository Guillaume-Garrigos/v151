title: " Complex Momentum for Optimization in Games "
abstract: " We generalize gradient descent with momentum for optimization in differentiable
  games to have complex-valued momentum. We give theoretical motivation for our method
  by proving convergence on bilinear zero-sum games for simultaneous and alternating
  updates. Our method gives real-valued parameter updates, making it a drop-in replacement
  for standard optimizers. We empirically demonstrate that complex-valued momentum
  can improve convergence in realistic adversarial games–like generative adversarial
  networks– by showing we can find better solutions with an almost identical computational
  cost. We also show a practical complex-valued Adam variant, which we use to train
  BigGAN to improve inception scores on CIFAR-10. "
