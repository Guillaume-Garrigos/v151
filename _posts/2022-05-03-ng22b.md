title: " On the Convergence of Continuous Constrained Optimization for Structure Learning "
abstract: " Recently, structure learning of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) has been
  formulated as a continuous optimization problem by leveraging an algebraic characterization
  of acyclicity. The constrained problem is solved using the augmented Lagrangian
  method (ALM) which is often preferred to the quadratic penalty method (QPM) by virtue
  of its standard convergence result that does not require the penalty coefficient
  to go to infinity, hence avoiding ill-conditioning. However, the convergence properties
  of these methods for structure learning, including whether they are guaranteed to
  return a DAG solution, remain unclear, which might limit their practical applications.
  In this work, we examine the convergence of ALM and QPM for structure learning in
  the linear, nonlinear, and confounded cases. We show that the standard convergence
  result of ALM does not hold in these settings, and demonstrate empirically that
  its behavior is akin to that of the QPM which is prone to ill-conditioning. We further
  establish the convergence guarantee of QPM to a DAG solution, under mild conditions.
  Lastly, we connect our theoretical results with existing approaches to help resolve
  the convergence issue, and verify our findings in light of an empirical comparison
  of them. "
