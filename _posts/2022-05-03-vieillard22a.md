title: " Implicitly Regularized RL with Implicit Q-values "
abstract: " The $Q$-function is a central quantity in many Reinforcement Learning
  (RL) algorithms for which RL agents behave following a (soft)-greedy policy w.r.t.
  to $Q$. It is a powerful tool that allows action selection without a model of the
  environment and even without explicitly modeling the policy. Yet, this scheme can
  only be used in discrete action tasks, with small numbers of actions, as the softmax
  over actions cannot be computed exactly otherwise. More specifically, the usage
  of function approximation to deal with continuous action spaces in modern actor-critic
  architectures intrinsically prevents the exact computation of a softmax. We propose
  to alleviate this issue by parametrizing the $Q$-function implicitly, as the sum
  of a log-policy and a value function. We use the resulting parametrization to derive
  a practical off-policy deep RL algorithm, suitable for large action spaces, and
  that enforces the softmax relation between the policy and the $Q$-value. We provide
  a theoretical analysis of our algorithm: from an Approximate Dynamic Programming
  perspective, we show its equivalence to a regularized version of value iteration,
  accounting for both entropy and Kullback-Leibler regularization, and that enjoys
  beneficial error propagation results. We then evaluate our algorithm on classic
  control tasks, where its results compete with state-of-the-art methods. "
