title: " Privacy Amplification by Decentralization "
abstract: " Analyzing data owned by several parties while achieving a good trade-off
  between utility and privacy is a key challenge in federated learning and analytics.
  In this work, we introduce a novel relaxation of local differential privacy (LDP)
  that naturally arises in fully decentralized algorithms, i.e., when participants
  exchange information by communicating along the edges of a network graph without
  central coordinator. This relaxation, that we call network DP, captures the fact
  that users have only a local view of the system. To show the relevance of network
  DP, we study a decentralized model of computation where a token performs a walk
  on the network graph and is updated sequentially by the party who receives it. For
  tasks such as real summation, histogram computation and optimization with gradient
  descent, we propose simple algorithms on ring and complete topologies. We prove
  that the privacy-utility trade-offs of our algorithms under network DP significantly
  improve upon what is achievable under LDP, and often match the utility of the trusted
  curator model. Our results show for the first time that formal privacy gains can
  be obtained from full decentralization. We also provide experiments to illustrate
  the improved utility of our approach for decentralized training with stochastic
  gradient descent. "
