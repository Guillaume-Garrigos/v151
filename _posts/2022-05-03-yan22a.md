title: " Margin-distancing for safe model explanation "
abstract: " The growing use of machine learning models in consequential settings has
  highlighted an important and seemingly irreconcilable tension between transparency
  and vulnerability to gaming. While this has sparked sizable debate in legal literature,
  there has been comparatively less technical study of this contention. In this work,
  we propose a clean-cut formulation of this tension and a way to make the tradeoff
  between transparency and gaming. We identify the source of gaming as being points
  close to the decision boundary of the model. And we initiate an investigation on
  how to provide example-based explanations that are expansive and yet consistent
  with a version space that is sufficiently uncertain with respect to the boundary
  pointsâ€™ labels. Finally, we furnish our theoretical results with empirical investigations
  of this tradeoff on real-world datasets. "
