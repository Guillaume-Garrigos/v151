title: " Conditionally Tractable Density Estimation using Neural Networks "
abstract: " Tractable models such as cutset networks and sum-product networks (SPNs)
  have become increasingly popular because they have superior predictive performance.
  Among them, cutset networks, which model the mechanics of Pearl’s cutset conditioning
  algorithm, demonstrate great scalability and prediction accuracy. Existing research
  on cutset networks has mainly focused on discrete domains, and the best mechanism
  to extend cutset networks to continuous domains is unclear. We propose one possible
  alternative to cutset networks that models the full joint distribution as the product
  of a local, complex distribution over a small subset of variables and a fully tractable
  conditional distribution whose parameters are controlled using a neural network.
  This model admits exact inference when all variables in the local distribution are
  observed, and although the model is not fully tractable in general, we show that
  “cutset” sampling can be employed to efficiently generate accurate predictions in
  practice. We show that our model performs comparably or better than existing competitors
  through a variety of prediction tasks on real datasets. "
