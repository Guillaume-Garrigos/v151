title: " Sample-and-threshold differential privacy: Histograms and applications "
abstract: " Federated analytics seeks to compute accurate statistics from data distributed
  across usersâ€™ devices while providing a suitable privacy guarantee and being practically
  feasible to implement and scale. In this paper, we show how a strong (epsilon, delta)-Differential
  Privacy (DP) guarantee can be achieved for the fundamental problem of histogram
  generation in a federated setting, via a highly practical sampling-based procedure
  that does not add noise to disclosed data. Given the ubiquity of sampling in practice,
  we thus obtain a DP guarantee almost for free, avoid over-estimating histogram counts,
  and allow easy reasoning about how privacy guarantees may obscure minorities and
  outliers. Using such histograms, related problems such as heavy hitters and quantiles
  can be answered with provable error and privacy guarantees. Experimental results
  show that our sample-and-threshold approach is accurate and scalable. "
