title: " A general class of surrogate functions for stable and efficient reinforcement
  learning "
abstract: " Common policy gradient methods rely on the maximization of a sequence
  of surrogate functions. In recent years, many such surrogate functions have been
  proposed, most without strong theoretical guarantees, leading to algorithms such
  as TRPO, PPO, or MPO. Rather than design yet another surrogate function, we instead
  propose a general framework (FMA-PG) based on functional mirror ascent that gives
  rise to an entire family of surrogate functions. We construct surrogate functions
  that enable policy improvement guarantees, a property not shared by most existing
  surrogate functions. Crucially, these guarantees hold regardless of the choice of
  policy parameterization. Moreover, a particular instantiation of FMA-PG recovers
  important implementation heuristics (e.g., using forward vs reverse KL divergence)
  resulting in a variant of TRPO with additional desirable properties. Via experiments
  on simple reinforcement learning problems, we evaluate the algorithms instantiated
  by FMA-PG. The proposed framework also suggests an improved variant of PPO, whose
  robustness and efficiency we empirically demonstrate on the MuJoCo suite. "
