title: " Bayesian Link Prediction with Deep Graph Convolutional Gaussian Processes "
abstract: " Link prediction aims to reveal missing edges in a graph. We introduce
  a deep graph convolutional Gaussian process model for this task, which addresses
  recent challenges in graph machine learning with oversmoothing and overfitting.
  Using simplified graph convolutions, we transform a Gaussian process to leverage
  the topological information of the graph domain. To scale the Gaussian process model
  to larger graphs, we introduce a variational inducing point method that places pseudo-inputs
  on a graph-structured domain. Multiple Gaussian processes are assembled into a hierarchy
  whose structure allows skipping convolutions and thus counteracting oversmoothing.
  The proposed model represents the first Gaussian process for link prediction that
  makes use of both node features and topological information. We evaluate our model
  on multiple graph data sets with up to thousands of nodes and report consistent
  improvements over competitive link prediction approaches. "
