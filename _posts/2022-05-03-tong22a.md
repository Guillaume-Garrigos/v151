title: " Scaling and Scalability: Provable Nonconvex Low-Rank Tensor Completion "
abstract: " Tensors, which provide a powerful and flexible model for representing
  multi-attribute data and multi-way interactions, play an indispensable role in modern
  data science across various fields in science and engineering. A fundamental task
  is tensor completion, which aims to faithfully recover the tensor from a small subset
  of its entries in a statistically and computationally efficient manner. Harnessing
  the low-rank structure of tensors in the Tucker decomposition, this paper develops
  a scaled gradient descent (ScaledGD) algorithm to directly recover the tensor factors
  with tailored spectral initializations, and shows that it provably converges at
  a linear rate independent of the condition number of the ground truth tensor for
  tensor completion as soon as the sample size is above the order of $n^{3/2}$ ignoring
  other parameter dependencies, where $n$ is the dimension of the tensor. To the best
  of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first algorithm that achieves near-optimal statistical
  and computational complexities simultaneously for low-rank tensor completion with
  the Tucker decomposition. Our algorithm highlights the power of appropriate preconditioning
  in accelerating nonconvex statistical estimation, where the iteration-varying preconditioners
  promote desirable invariance properties of the trajectory with respect to the underlying
  symmetry in low-rank tensor factorization. "
