title: " Information-Theoretic Analysis of Epistemic Uncertainty in Bayesian Meta-learning "
abstract: " The overall predictive uncertainty of a trained predictor can be decomposed
  into separate contributions due to epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. Under a
  Bayesian formulation, assuming a well-specified model, the two contributions can
  be exactly expressed (for the log-loss) or bounded (for more general losses) in
  terms of information-theoretic quantities (Xu and Raginsky [2020]). This paper addresses
  the study of epistemic uncertainty within an information-theoretic framework in
  the broader setting of Bayesian meta-learning. A general hierarchical Bayesian model
  is assumed in which hyperparameters determine the per-task priors of the model parameters.
  Exact characterizations (for the log-loss) and bounds (for more general losses)
  are derived for the epistemic uncertainty – quantified by the minimum excess meta-risk
  (MEMR)– of optimal meta-learning rules. This characterization is leveraged to bring
  insights into the dependence of the epistemic uncertainty on the number of tasks
  and on the amount of per-task training data. Experiments are presented that use
  the proposed information-theoretic bounds, evaluated via neural mutual information
  estimators, to compare the performance of conventional learning and meta-learning
  as the number of meta-learning tasks increases. "
