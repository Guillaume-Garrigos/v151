title: " Causal Effect Identification with Context-specific Independence Relations
  of Control Variables "
abstract: " We study the problem of causal effect identification from observational
  distribution given the causal graph and some context-specific independence (CSI)
  relations. It was recently shown that this problem is NP-hard, and while a sound
  algorithm to learn the causal effects is proposed in Tikka et al. (2019), no complete
  algorithm for the task exists. In this work, we propose a sound and complete algorithm
  for the setting when the CSI relations are limited to observed nodes with no parents
  in the causal graph. One limitation of the state of the art in terms of its applicability
  is that the CSI relations among all variables, even unobserved ones, must be given
  (as opposed to learned). Instead, We introduce a set of graphical constraints under
  which the CSI relations can be learned from mere observational distribution. This
  expands the set of identifiable causal effects beyond the state of the art. "
