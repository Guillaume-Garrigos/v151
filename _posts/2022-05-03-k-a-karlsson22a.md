title: " Using time-series privileged information for provably efficient learning
  of prediction models "
abstract: " We study prediction of future outcomes with supervised models that use
  privileged information during learning. The privileged information comprises samples
  of time series observed between the baseline time of prediction and the future outcome;
  this information is only available at training time which differs from the traditional
  supervised learning. Our question is when using this privileged data leads to more
  sample-efficient learning of models that use only baseline data for predictions
  at test time. We give an algorithm for this setting and prove that when the time
  series are drawn from a non-stationary Gaussian-linear dynamical system of fixed
  horizon, learning with privileged information is more efficient than learning without
  it. On synthetic data, we test the limits of our algorithm and theory, both when
  our assumptions hold and when they are violated. On three diverse real-world datasets,
  we show that our approach is generally preferable to classical learning, particularly
  when data is scarce. Finally, we relate our estimator to a distillation approach
  both theoretically and empirically. "
