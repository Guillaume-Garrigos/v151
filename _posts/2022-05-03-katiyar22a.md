title: " Recoverability Landscape of Tree Structured Markov Random Fields under Symmetric
  Noise "
abstract: " We study the problem of learning tree-structured Markov random fields
  (MRF) on discrete random variables with common support when the observations are
  corrupted by a k-ary symmetric noise channel with unknown probability of error.
  For Ising models (support size = 2), past work has shown that graph structure can
  only be recovered up to the leaf clusters (a leaf node, its parent, and its siblings
  form a leaf cluster) and exact recovery is impossible. No prior work has addressed
  the setting of support size of 3 or more, and indeed this setting is far richer.
  As we show, when the support size is 3 or more, the structure of the leaf clusters
  may be partially or fully identifiable. We provide a precise characterization of
  this phenomenon and show that the extent of recoverability is dictated by the joint
  PMF of the random variables. In particular, we provide necessary and sufficient
  conditions for exact recoverability. Furthermore, we present a polynomial time,
  sample efficient algorithm that recovers the exact tree when this is possible, or
  up to the unidentifiability as promised by our characterization, when full recoverability
  is impossible. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm experimentally. "
