title: " Statistical Depth Functions for Ranking Distributions: Definitions, Statistical
  Learning and Applications "
abstract: " The concept of median/consensus has been widely investigated in order
  to provide a statistical summary of ranking data, i.e. realizations of a random
  permutation $\\Sigma$ of a finite set, $\\{1,; \\ldots,;{n}\\}$ with $n\\geq 1$
  say. As it sheds light onto only one aspect of $\\Sigma$â€™s distribution $P$, it
  may neglect other informative features. It is the purpose of this paper to define
  analogues of quantiles, ranks and statistical procedures based on such quantities
  for the analysis of ranking data by means of a metric-based notion of depth function
  on the symmetric group. Overcoming the absence of vector space structure on $\\mathfrak{S}_n$,
  the latter defines a center-outward ordering of the permutations in the support
  of $P$ and extends the classic metric-based formulation of consensus ranking (medians
  corresponding then to the deepest permutations). The axiomatic properties that ranking
  depths should ideally possess are listed, while computational and generalization
  issues are studied at length. Beyond the theoretical analysis carried out, the relevance
  of the novel concepts and methods introduced for a wide variety of statistical tasks
  are also supported by numerous numerical experiments. "
