title: " Robust Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting "
abstract: " Probabilistic time series forecasting has played critical role in decision-making
  processes due to its capability to quantify uncertainties. Deep forecasting models,
  however, could be prone to input perturbations, and the notion of such perturbations,
  together with that of robustness, has not even been completely established in the
  regime of probabilistic forecasting. In this work, we propose a framework for robust
  probabilistic time series forecasting. First, we generalize the concept of adversarial
  input perturbations, based on which we formulate the concept of robustness in terms
  of bounded Wasserstein deviation. Then we extend the randomized smoothing technique
  to attain robust probabilistic forecasters with theoretical robustness certificates
  against certain classes of adversarial perturbations. Lastly, extensive experiments
  demonstrate that our methods are empirically effective in enhancing the forecast
  quality under additive adversarial attacks and forecast consistency under supplement
  of noisy observations. The code for our experiments is available at https://github.com/tetrzim/robust-probabilistic-forecasting. "
