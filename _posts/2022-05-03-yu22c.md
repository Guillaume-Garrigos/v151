title: " Learning from Multiple Noisy Partial Labelers "
abstract: " Programmatic weak supervision creates models without hand-labeled training
  data by combining the outputs of heuristic labelers. Existing frameworks make the
  restrictive assumption that labelers output a single class label. Enabling users
  to create partial labelers that output subsets of possible class labels would greatly
  expand the expressivity of programmatic weak supervision. We introduce this capability
  by defining a probabilistic generative model that can estimate the underlying accuracies
  of multiple noisy partial labelers without ground truth labels. We show how to scale
  up learning, for example learning on 100k examples in one minute, a 300$\\times$
  speed up compared to a naive implementation. We also prove that this class of models
  is generically identifiable up to label swapping under mild conditions. We evaluate
  our framework on three text classification and six object classification tasks.
  On text tasks, adding partial labels increases average accuracy by 8.6 percentage
  points. On image tasks, we show that partial labels allow us to approach some zero-shot
  object classification problems with programmatic weak supervision by using class
  attributes as partial labelers. On these tasks, our framework has accuracy comparable
  to recent embedding-based zero-shot learning methods, while using only pre-trained
  attribute detectors. "
