title: " Nearly Minimax Optimal Regret for Learning Infinite-horizon Average-reward
  MDPs with Linear Function Approximation "
abstract: " We study reinforcement learning in an infinite-horizon average-reward
  setting with linear function approximation for linear mixture Markov decision processes
  (MDPs), where the transition probability function of the underlying MDP admits a
  linear form over a feature mapping of the current state, action, and next state.
  We propose a new algorithm UCRL2-VTR, which can be seen as an extension of the UCRL2
  algorithm with linear function approximation. We show that UCRL2-VTR with Bernstein-type
  bonus can achieve a regret of $\\tilde{O}(d\\sqrt{DT})$, where $d$ is the dimension
  of the feature mapping, $T$ is the horizon, and $D$ is the diameter of the MDP.
  We also prove a matching lower bound $\\tilde{\\Omega}(d\\sqrt{DT})$, which suggests
  that the proposed UCRL2-VTR is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors. To the
  best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first nearly minimax optimal RL algorithm
  with function approximation in the infinite-horizon average-reward setting. "
