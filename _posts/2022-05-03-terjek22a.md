title: " Optimal transport with $f$-divergence regularization and generalized Sinkhorn
  algorithm "
abstract: " Entropic regularization provides a generalization of the original optimal
  transport problem. It introduces a penalty term defined by the Kullback-Leibler
  divergence, making the problem more tractable via the celebrated Sinkhorn algorithm.
  Replacing the Kullback-Leibler divergence with a general $f$-divergence leads to
  a natural generalization. The case of divergences defined by superlinear functions
  was recently studied by Di Marino and Gerolin. Using convex analysis, we extend
  the theory developed so far to include all $f$-divergences defined by functions
  of Legendre type, and prove that under some mild conditions, strong duality holds,
  optimums in both the primal and dual problems are attained, the generalization of
  the $c$-transform is well-defined, and we give sufficient conditions for the generalized
  Sinkhorn algorithm to converge to an optimal solution. We propose a practical algorithm
  for computing an approximate solution of the optimal transport problem with $f$-divergence
  regularization via the generalized Sinkhorn algorithm. Finally, we present experimental
  results on synthetic 2-dimensional data, demonstrating the effects of using different
  $f$-divergences for regularization, which influences convergence speed, numerical
  stability and sparsity of the optimal coupling. "
