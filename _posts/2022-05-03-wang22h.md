title: " Best Arm Identification with Safety Constraints "
abstract: " The best arm identification problem in the multi-armed bandit setting
  is an excellent model of many real-world decision-making problems, yet it fails
  to capture the fact that in the real-world, safety constraints often must be met
  while learning. In this work we study the question of best-arm identification in
  safety-critical settings, where the goal of the agent is to find the best safe option
  out of many, while exploring in a way that guarantees certain, initially unknown
  safety constraints are met. We first analyze this problem in the setting where the
  reward and safety constraint takes a linear structure, and show nearly matching
  upper and lower bounds. We then analyze a much more general version of the problem
  where we only assume the reward and safety constraint can be modeled by monotonic
  functions, and propose an algorithm in this setting which is guaranteed to learn
  safely. We conclude with experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of
  our approaches in scenarios such as safely identifying the best drug out of many
  in order to treat an illness. "
