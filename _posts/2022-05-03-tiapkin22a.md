title: " Primal-Dual Stochastic Mirror Descent for MDPs "
abstract: " We consider the problem of learning the optimal policy for infinite-horizon
  Markov decision processes (MDPs). For this purpose, some variant of Stochastic Mirror
  Descent is proposed for convex programming problems with Lipschitz-continuous functionals.
  An important detail is the ability to use inexact values of functional constraints
  and compute the value of dual variables. We analyze this algorithm in a general
  case and obtain an estimate of the convergence rate that does not accumulate errors
  during the operation of the method. Using this algorithm, we get the first parallel
  algorithm for mixing average-reward MDPs with a generative model without reduction
  to discounted MDP. One of the main features of the presented method is low communication
  costs in a distributed centralized setting, even with very large networks. "
