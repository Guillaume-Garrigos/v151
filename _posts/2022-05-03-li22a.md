title: " Gaussian Process Bandit Optimization with Few Batches "
abstract: " In this paper, we consider the problem of black-box optimization using
  Gaussian Process (GP) bandit optimization with a small number of batches. Assuming
  the unknown function has a low norm in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS),
  we introduce a batch algorithm inspired by batched finite-arm bandit algorithms,
  and show that it achieves the cumulative regret upper bound $O^\\ast(\\sqrt{T\\gamma_T})$
  using $O(\\log\\log T)$ batches within time horizon $T$, where the $O^\\ast(\\cdot)$
  notation hides dimension-independent logarithmic factors and $\\gamma_T$ is the
  maximum information gain associated with the kernel. This bound is near-optimal
  for several kernels of interest and improves on the typical $O^\\ast(\\sqrt{T}\\gamma_T)$
  bound, and our approach is arguably the simplest among algorithms attaining this
  improvement. In addition, in the case of a constant number of batches (not depending
  on $T$), we propose a modified version of our algorithm, and characterize how the
  regret is impacted by the number of batches, focusing on the squared exponential
  and Matern kernels. The algorithmic upper bounds are shown to be nearly minimax
  optimal via analogous algorithm-independent lower bounds. "
