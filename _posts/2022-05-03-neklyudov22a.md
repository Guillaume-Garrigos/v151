title: " Orbital MCMC "
abstract: " Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms ubiquitously employ complex
  deterministic transformations to generate proposal points that are then filtered
  by the Metropolis-Hastings-Green (MHG) test. However, the condition of the target
  measure invariance puts restrictions on the design of these transformations. In
  this paper, we first derive the acceptance test for the stochastic Markov kernel
  considering arbitrary deterministic maps as proposal generators. When applied to
  the transformations with orbits of period two (involutions), the test reduces to
  the MHG test. Based on the derived test we propose two practical algorithms: one
  operates by constructing periodic orbits from any diffeomorphism, another on contractions
  of the state space (such as optimization trajectories). Finally, we perform an empirical
  study demonstrating the practical advantages of both kernels. "
