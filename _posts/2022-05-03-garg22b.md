title: " An Alternate Policy Gradient Estimator for Softmax Policies "
abstract: " Policy gradient (PG) estimators are ineffective in dealing with softmax
  policies that are sub-optimally saturated, which refers to the situation when the
  policy concentrates its probability mass on sub-optimal actions. Sub-optimal policy
  saturation may arise from bad policy initialization or sudden changes in the environment
  that occur after the policy has already converged. Current softmax PG estimators
  require a large number of updates to overcome policy saturation, which causes low
  sample efficiency and poor adaptability to new situations. To mitigate this problem,
  we propose a novel PG estimator for softmax policies that utilizes the bias in the
  critic estimate and the noise present in the reward signal to escape the saturated
  regions of the policy parameter space. Our theoretical analysis and experiments,
  conducted on bandits and various reinforcement learning environments, show that
  this new estimator is significantly more robust to policy saturation. "
