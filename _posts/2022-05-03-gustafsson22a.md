title: " Learning Proposals for Practical Energy-Based Regression "
abstract: " Energy-based models (EBMs) have experienced a resurgence within machine
  learning in recent years, including as a promising alternative for probabilistic
  regression. However, energy-based regression requires a proposal distribution to
  be manually designed for training, and an initial estimate has to be provided at
  test-time. We address both of these issues by introducing a conceptually simple
  method to automatically learn an effective proposal distribution, which is parameterized
  by a separate network head. To this end, we derive a surprising result, leading
  to a unified training objective that jointly minimizes the KL divergence from the
  proposal to the EBM, and the negative log-likelihood of the EBM. At test-time, we
  can then employ importance sampling with the trained proposal to efficiently evaluate
  the learned EBM and produce stand-alone predictions. Furthermore, we utilize our
  derived training objective to learn mixture density networks (MDNs) with a jointly
  trained energy-based teacher, consistently outperforming conventional MDN training
  on four real-world regression tasks within computer vision. Code is available at
