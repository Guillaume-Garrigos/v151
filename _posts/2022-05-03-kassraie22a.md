title: " Neural Contextual Bandits without Regret "
abstract: " Contextual bandits are a rich model for sequential decision making given
  side information, with important applications, e.g., in recommender systems. We
  propose novel algorithms for contextual bandits harnessing neural networks to approximate
  the unknown reward function. We resolve the open problem of proving sublinear regret
  bounds in this setting for general context sequences, considering both fully-connected
  and convolutional networks. To this end, we first analyze NTK-UCB, a kernelized
  bandit optimization algorithm employing the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), and bound
  its regret in terms of the NTK maximum information gain $\\gamma_T$, a complexity
  parameter capturing the difficulty of learning. Our bounds on $\\gamma_T$ for the
  NTK may be of independent interest. We then introduce our neural network based algorithm
  NN-UCB, and show that its regret closely tracks that of NTK-UCB. Under broad non-parametric
  assumptions about the reward function, our approach converges to the optimal policy
  at a $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/2d})$ rate, where $d$ is the dimension of the
  context. "
