title: " Contrasting the landscape of contrastive and non-contrastive learning "
abstract: " A lot of recent advances in unsupervised feature learning are based on
  designing features which are invariant under semantic data augmentations. A common
  way to do this is contrastive learning, which uses positive and negative samples.
  Some recent works however have shown promising results for non-contrastive learning,
  which does not require negative samples. However, the non-contrastive losses have
  obvious “collapsed” minima, in which the encoders output a constant feature embedding,
  independent of the input. A folk conjecture is that so long as these collapsed solutions
  are avoided, the produced feature representations should be good. In our paper,
  we cast doubt on this story: we show through theoretical results and controlled
  experiments that even on simple data models, non-contrastive losses have a preponderance
  of non-collapsed bad minima. Moreover, we show that the training process does not
  avoid these minima. Code for this work can be found at https://github.com/ashwinipokle/contrastive_landscape. "
