title: " Orthogonal Multi-Manifold Enriching of Directed Networks "
abstract: " Directed Acyclic Graphs and trees are widely prevalent in several real-world
  applications. These hierarchical structures show intriguing properties such as scale-free
  and bipartite nature, with fine-grained temporal irregularities among nodes. Building
  on advances in geometrical deep learning, we explore a time-aware neural network
  to model trees and Directed Acyclic Graphs in multiple Riemannian manifolds of varying
  curvatures. To jointly utilize the strength of these manifolds, we propose <b>M</b>ulti-Manifold
  <b>R</b>ecursive <b>I</b>nteraction <b>L</b>earning (<b>MRIL</b>) on Directed Acyclic
  Graphs where we introduce an inter-manifold learning mechanism that recursively
  enriches each manifold with representations from sibling manifolds. We propose the
  integration of the Stiefel orthogonality constraint which stabilizes the training
  process in Riemannian manifolds. Through a series of quantitative and exploratory
  experiments, we show that our method achieves competitive performance and converges
  much faster on data spanning several domains. "
