title: " The role of optimization geometry in single neuron learning "
abstract: " Recent numerical experiments have demonstrated that the choice of optimization
  geometry used during training can impact generalization performance when learning
  expressive nonlinear model classes such as deep neural networks. These observations
  have important implications for modern deep learning, but remain poorly understood
  due to the difficulty of the associated nonconvex optimization. Towards an understanding
  of this phenomenon, we analyze a family of pseudogradient methods for learning generalized
  linear models under the square loss â€“ a simplified problem containing both nonlinearity
  in the model parameters and nonconvexity of the optimization which admits a single
  neuron as a special case. We prove non-asymptotic bounds on the generalization error
  that sharply characterize how the interplay between the optimization geometry and
  the feature space geometry sets the out-of-sample performance of the learned model.
  Experimentally, selecting the optimization geometry as suggested by our theory leads
  to improved performance in generalized linear model estimation problems such as
  nonlinear and nonconvex variants of sparse vector recovery and low-rank matrix sensing. "
