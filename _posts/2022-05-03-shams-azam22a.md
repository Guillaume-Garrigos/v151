title: " Can we Generalize and Distribute Private Representation Learning? "
abstract: ' We study the problem of learning representations that are private yet
  informative i.e., provide information about intended "ally" targets while hiding
  sensitive "adversary" attributes. We propose Exclusion-Inclusion Generative Adversarial
  Network (EIGAN), a generalized private representation learning (PRL) architecture
  that accounts for multiple ally and adversary attributes unlike existing PRL solutions.
  While centrally-aggregated dataset is a prerequisite for most PRL techniques, data
  in real-world is often siloed across multiple distributed nodes unwilling to share
  the raw data because of privacy concerns. We address this practical constraint by
  developing D-EIGAN, the first distributed PRL method that learns representations
  at each node without transmitting the source data. We theoretically analyze the
  behavior of adversaries under the optimal EIGAN and D-EIGAN encoders and the impact
  of dependencies among ally and adversary tasks on the optimization objective. Our
  experiments on various datasets demonstrate the advantages of EIGAN in terms of
  performance, robustness, and scalability. In particular, EIGAN outperforms the previous
  state-of-the-art by a significant accuracy margin ($47%$ improvement), and D-EIGANâ€™s
  performance is consistently on par with EIGAN under different network settings. '
