title: " Triple-Q: A Model-Free Algorithm for Constrained Reinforcement Learning with
  Sublinear Regret and Zero Constraint Violation "
abstract: " This paper presents the first model-free, simulator-free reinforcement
  learning algorithm for Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) with sublinear
  regret and zero constraint violation. The algorithm is named Triple-Q because it
  includes three key components: a Q-function (also called action-value function)
  for the cumulative reward, a Q-function for the cumulative utility for the constraint,
  and a virtual-Queue that (over)-estimates the cumulative constraint violation. Under
  Triple-Q, at each step, an action is chosen based on the pseudo-Q-value that is
  a combination of the three “Q” values. The algorithm updates the reward and utility
  Q-values with learning rates that depend on the visit counts to the corresponding
  (state, action) pairs and are periodically reset. In the episodic CMDP setting,
  Triple-Q achieves $\\tilde{\\cal O}\\left(\\frac{1 }{\\delta}H^4 S^{\\frac{1}{2}}A^{\\frac{1}{2}}K^{\\frac{4}{5}}
  \\right)$ regret, where $K$ is the total number of episodes, $H$ is the number of
  steps in each episode, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions,
  and $\\delta$ is Slater’s constant. Furthermore, {Triple-Q} guarantees zero constraint
  violation, both on expectation and with a high probability, when $K$ is sufficiently
  large. Finally, the computational complexity of {Triple-Q} is similar to SARSA for
  unconstrained MDPs, and is computationally efficient. "
