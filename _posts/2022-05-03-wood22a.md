title: " Bias-Variance Decompositions for Margin Losses "
abstract: ' We introduce a novel bias-variance decomposition for a range of strictly
  convex margin losses, including the logistic loss (minimized by the classic LogitBoost
  algorithm) as well as the squared margin loss and canonical boosting loss. Furthermore
  we show that, for all strictly convex margin losses, the expected risk decomposes
  into the risk of a "central" model and a term quantifying variation in the functional
  margin with respect to variations in the training data. These decompositions provide
  a diagnostic tool for practitioners to understand model overfitting/underfitting,
  and have implications for additive ensemble modelsâ€”for example, when our bias-variance
  decomposition holds, there is a corresponding "ambiguity" decomposition, which can
  be used to quantify model diversity. '
