title: " Standardisation-function Kernel Stein Discrepancy: A Unifying View on Kernel
  Stein Discrepancy Tests for Goodness-of-fit "
abstract: " Non-parametric goodness-of-fit testing procedures based on kernel Stein
  discrepancies (KSD) are promising approaches to validate general unnormalised distributions
  in various scenarios. Existing works focused on studying kernel choices to boost
  test performances. However, the choices of (non-unique) Stein operators also have
  considerable effect on the test performances. Inspired by the standardisation technique
  that was originally developed to better derive approximation properties for normal
  distributions, we present a unifying framework, called standardisation-function
  kernel Stein discrepancy (Sf-KSD), to study different Stein operators in KSD-based
  tests for goodness-of-fit. We derive explicitly how the proposed framework relates
  to existing KSD-based tests and show that Sf-KSD can be used as a guide to develop
  novel kernel-based non-parametric tests on complex data scenarios, e.g. truncated
  distributions or compositional data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
  tests control type-I error well and achieve higher test power than existing approaches. "
