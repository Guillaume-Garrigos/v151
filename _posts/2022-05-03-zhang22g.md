title: " Private Sequential Hypothesis Testing for Statisticians: Privacy, Error Rates,
  and Sample Size "
abstract: " The sequential hypothesis testing problem is a class of statistical analyses
  where the sample size is not fixed in advance. Instead, the decision-process takes
  in new observations sequentially to make real-time decisions for testing an alternative
  hypothesis against a null hypothesis until some stopping criterion is satisfied.
  In many common applications of sequential hypothesis testing, the data can be highly
  sensitive and may require privacy protection; for example, sequential hypothesis
  testing is used in clinical trials, where doctors sequentially collect data from
  patients and must determine when to stop recruiting patients and whether the treatment
  is effective. The field of differential privacy has been developed to offer data
  analysis tools with strong privacy guarantees, and has been commonly applied to
  machine learning and statistical tasks. In this work, we study the sequential hypothesis
  testing problem under a slight variant of differential privacy, known as Renyi differential
  privacy. We present a new private algorithm based on Waldâ€™s Sequential Probability
  Ratio Test (SPRT) that also gives strong theoretical privacy guarantees. We provide
  theoretical analysis on statistical performance measured by Type I and Type II error
  as well as the expected sample size. We also empirically validate our theoretical
  results on several synthetic databases, showing that our algorithms also perform
  well in practice. Unlike previous work in private hypothesis testing that focused
  only on the classical fixed sample setting, our results in the sequential setting
  allow a conclusion to be reached much earlier, and thus saving the cost of collecting
  additional samples. "
