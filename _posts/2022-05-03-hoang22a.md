title: " Learning Personalized Item-to-Item Recommendation Metric via Implicit Feedback "
abstract: " This paper studies the item-to-item recommendation problem in recommender
  systems from a new perspective of metric learning via implicit feedback. We develop
  and investigate a personalizable deep metric model that captures both the internal
  contents of items and how they were interacted with by users. There are two key
  challenges in learning such model. First, there is no explicit similarity annotation,
  which deviates from the assumption of most metric learning methods. Second, these
  approaches do not account for the fact that items are often represented by multiple
  sources of meta data and different users use different combinations of these sources
  to form their own notion of similarity. To address these challenges, we develop
  a new metric representation embedded as kernel parameters of a probabilistic model.
  This helps express the correlation between items that a user has interacted with,
  which can be used to predict user interaction with new items. Our approach hinges
  on the intuition that similar items induce similar interactions from the same user,
  thus fitting a metric-parameterized model to predict an implicit feedback signal
  could indirectly guide it towards finding the most suitable metric for each user.
  To this end, we also analyze how and when the proposed method is effective from
  a theoretical lens. Its empirical effectiveness is also demonstrated on several
  real-world datasets. "
