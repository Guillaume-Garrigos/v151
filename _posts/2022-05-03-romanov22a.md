title: " Spiked Covariance Estimation from Modulo-Reduced Measurements "
abstract: " Consider the rank-1 spiked model: $\\bf{X}=\\sqrt{\\nu}\\xi \\bf{u}+ \\bf{Z}$,
  where $\\nu$ is the spike intensity, $\\bf{u}\\in\\mathbb{S}^{k-1}$ is an unknown
  direction and $\\xi\\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1),\\bf{Z}\\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\bf{0},\\bf{I})$.
  Motivated by recent advances in analog-to-digital conversion, we study the problem
  of recovering $\\bf{u}\\in \\mathbb{S}^{k-1}$ from $n$ i.i.d. modulo-reduced measurements
  $\\bf{Y}=[\\bf{X}]\\mod \\Delta$, focusing on the high-dimensional regime ($k\\gg
  1$). We develop and analyze an algorithm that, for most directions $\\bf{u}$ and
  $\\nu=\\mathrm{poly}(k)$, estimates $\\bf{u}$ to high accuracy using $n=\\mathrm{poly}(k)$
  measurements, provided that $\\Delta\\gtrsim \\sqrt{\\log k}$. Up to constants,
  our algorithm accurately estimates $\\bf{u}$ at the smallest possible $\\Delta$
  that allows (in an information-theoretic sense) to recover $\\bf{X}$ from $\\bf{Y}$.
  A key step in our analysis involves estimating the probability that a line segment
  of length $\\approx\\sqrt{\\nu}$ in a random direction $\\bf{u}$ passes near a point
  in the lattice $\\Delta \\mathbb{Z}^k$. Numerical experiments show that the developed
  algorithm performs well even in a non-asymptotic setting. "
