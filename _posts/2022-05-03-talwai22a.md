title: " Sobolev Norm Learning Rates for Conditional Mean Embeddings "
abstract: " We develop novel learning rates for conditional mean embeddings by applying
  the theory of interpolation for reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). We derive
  explicit, adaptive convergence rates for the sample estimator under the misspecifed
  setting, where the target operator is not Hilbert-Schmidt or bounded with respect
  to the input/output RKHSs. We demonstrate that in certain parameter regimes, we
  can achieve uniform convergence rates in the output RKHS. We hope our analyses will
  allow the much broader application of conditional mean embeddings to more complex
  ML/RL settings involving infinite dimensional RKHSs and continuous state spaces. "
