title: " Loss as the Inconsistency of a Probabilistic Dependency Graph: Choose Your
  Model, Not Your Loss Function "
abstract: ' In a world blessed with a great diversity of loss functions, we argue
  that that choice between them is not a matter of taste or pragmatics, but of model.
  Probabilistic depencency graphs (PDGs) are probabilistic models that come equipped
  with a measure of "inconsistency". We prove that many standard loss functions arise
  as the inconsistency of a natural PDG describing the appropriate scenario, and use
  the same approach to justify a well-known connection between regularizers and priors.
  We also show that the PDG inconsistency captures a large class of statistical divergences,
  and detail benefits of thinking of them in this way, including an intuitive visual
  language for deriving inequalities between them. In variational inference, we find
  that the ELBO, a somewhat opaque objective for latent variable models, and variants
  of it arise for free out of uncontroversial modeling assumptionsâ€”as do simple graphical
  proofs of their corresponding bounds. Finally, we observe that inconsistency becomes
  the log partition function (free energy) in the setting where PDGs are factor graphs. '
