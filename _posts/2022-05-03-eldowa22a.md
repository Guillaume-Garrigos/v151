title: " Finite Sample Analysis of Mean-Volatility Actor-Critic for Risk-Averse Reinforcement
  Learning "
abstract: " The goal in the standard reinforcement learning problem is to find a policy
  that optimizes the expected return. However, such an objective is not adequate in
  a lot of real-life applications, like finance, where controlling the uncertainty
  of the outcome is imperative. The mean-volatility objective penalizes, through a
  tunable parameter, policies with high variance of the per-step reward. An interesting
  property of this objective is that it admits simple linear Bellman equations that
  resemble, up to a reward transformation, those of the risk-neutral case. However,
  the required reward transformation is policy-dependent, and requires the (usually
  unknown) expected return of the used policy. In this work, we propose two general
  methods for policy evaluation under the mean-volatility objective: the direct method
  and the factored method. We then extend recent results for finite sample analysis
  in the risk-neutral actor-critic setting to the mean-volatility case. Our analysis
  shows that the sample complexity to attain an $\\epsilon$-accurate stationary point
  is the same as that of the risk-neutral version, using either policy evaluation
  method for training the critic. Finally, we carry out experiments to test the proposed
  methods in a simple environment that exhibits some trade-off between optimality,
  in expectation, and uncertainty of outcome. "
