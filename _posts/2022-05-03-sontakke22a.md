title: " GalilAI: Out-of-Task Distribution Detection using Causal Active Experimentation
  for Safe Transfer RL "
abstract: " Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a well-studied topic in supervised
  learning. Extending the successes in supervised learning methods to the reinforcement
  learning (RL) setting, however, is difficult due to the data generating process
  - RL agents actively query their environment for data and this data is a function
  of the policy followed by the agent. Thus, an agent could neglect a shift in the
  environment if its policy did not lead it to explore the aspect of the environment
  that shifted. Therefore, to achieve safe and robust generalization in RL, there
  exists an unmet need for OOD detection through active experimentation. Here, we
  attempt to bridge this lacuna by first - defining a causal framework for OOD scenarios
  or environments encountered by RL agents in the wild. Then, we propose a novel task
  - that of Out-of-Task Distribution (OOTD) detection. We introduce an RL agent which
  actively experiments in a test environment and subsequently concludes whether it
  is OOTD or not. We name our method GalilAI, in honor of Galileo Galilei, as it also
  discovers, among other causal processes, that gravitational acceleration is independent
  of the mass of a body. Finally, we propose a simple probabilistic neural network
  baseline for comparison, which extends extant Model-Based RL. We find that our method
  outperforms the baseline significantly. "
