title: " Corruption-robust Offline Reinforcement Learning "
abstract: " We study the adversarial robustness in offline reinforcement learning.
  Given a batch dataset consisting of tuples $(s, a, r, sâ€™)$, an adversary is allowed
  to arbitrarily modify $\\epsilon$ fraction of the tuples. From the corrupted dataset
  the learner aims to robustly identify a near-optimal policy. We first show that
  a worst-case $\\Omega(d\\epsilon)$ optimality gap is unavoidable in linear MDP of
  dimension $d$, even if the adversary only corrupts the reward element in a tuple.
  This contrasts with dimension-free results in robust supervised learning and best-known
  lower-bound in the online RL setting with corruption. Next, we propose robust variants
  of the Least-Square Value Iteration (LSVI) algorithm utilizing robust supervised
  learning oracles, which achieve near-matching performances in cases both with and
  without full data coverage. The algorithm requires the knowledge of $\\epsilon$
  to design the pessimism bonus in the no-coverage case. Surprisingly, in this case,
  the knowledge of $\\epsilon$ is necessary, as we show that being adaptive to unknown
  $\\epsilon$ is impossible. This again contrasts with recent results on corruption-robust
  online RL and implies that robust offline RL is a strictly harder problem. "
