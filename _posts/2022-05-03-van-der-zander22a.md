title: " Identification in Tree-shaped Linear Structural Causal Models "
abstract: " Linear structural equation models represent direct causal effects as directed
  edges and confounding factors as bidirected edges. An open problem is to identify
  the causal parameters from correlations between the nodes. We investigate models,
  whose directed component forms a tree, and show that there, besides classical instrumental
  variables, missing cycles of bidirected edges can be used to identify the model.
  They can yield systems of quadratic equations that we explicitly solve to obtain
  one or two solutions for the causal parameters of adjacent directed edges. We show
  how multiple missing cycles can be combined to obtain a unique solution. This results
  in an algorithm that can identify instances that previously required approaches
  based on Gröbner bases, which have doubly-exponential time complexity in the number
  of structural parameters. "
