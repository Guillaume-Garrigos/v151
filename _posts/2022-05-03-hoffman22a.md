title: " Tuning-Free Generalized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo "
abstract: " Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has become a go-to family of Markov chain
  Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for Bayesian inference problems, in part because we
  have good procedures for automatically tuning its parameters. Much less attention
  has been paid to automatic tuning of generalized HMC (GHMC), in which the auxiliary
  momentum vector is partially updated frequently instead of being completely resampled
  infrequently. Since GHMC spreads progress over many iterations, it is not straightforward
  to tune GHMC based on quantities typically used to tune HMC such as average acceptance
  rate and squared jumped distance. In this work, we propose an ensemble-chain adaptation
  (ECA) algorithm for GHMC that automatically selects values for all of GHMC’s tunable
  parameters each iteration based on statistics collected from a population of many
  chains. This algorithm is designed to make good use of SIMD hardware accelerators
  such as GPUs, allowing most chains to be updated in parallel each iteration. Unlike
  typical adaptive-MCMC algorithms, our ECA algorithm does not perturb the chain’s
  stationary distribution, and therefore does not need to be “frozen” after warmup.
  Empirically, we find that the proposed algorithm quickly converges to its stationary
  distribution, producing accurate estimates of posterior expectations with relatively
  few gradient evaluations per chain. "
