title: " Off-Policy Risk Assessment for Markov Decision Processes "
abstract: " Addressing such diverse ends as mitigating safety risks, aligning agent
  behavior with human preferences, and improving the efficiency of learning, an emerging
  line of reinforcement learning research addresses the entire distribution of returns
  and various risk functionals that depend upon it. In the contextual bandit setting,
  recently work on off-policy risk assessment estimates the target policyâ€™s CDF of
  returns, providing finite sample guarantees that extend to (and hold simultaneously
  over) plugin estimates of an arbitrarily large set of risk functionals. In this
  paper, we lift OPRA to Markov decision processes (MDPs), where importance sampling
  (IS) CDF estimators suffer high variance on longer trajectories due to vanishing
  (and exploding) importance weights. To mitigate these problems, we incorporate model-based
  estimation to develop the first doubly robust (DR) estimator for the CDF of returns
  in MDPs. The DR estimator enjoys significantly less variance and, when the model
  is well specified, achieves the Cramer-Rao variance lower bound. Moreover, for many
  risk functionals, the downstream estimates enjoy both lower bias and lower variance.
  Additionally, we derive the first minimax lower bounds for off-policy CDF and risk
  estimation, which match our error bounds up to a constant. Finally, we demonstrate
  the efficacy of our DR CDF estimates experimentally on several different environments. "
