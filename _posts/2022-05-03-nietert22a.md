title: " Outlier-Robust Optimal Transport: Duality, Structure, and Statistical Analysis "
abstract: " The Wasserstein distance, rooted in optimal transport (OT) theory, is
  a popular discrepancy measure between probability distributions with various applications
  to statistics and machine learning. Despite their rich structure and demonstrated
  utility, Wasserstein distances are sensitive to outliers in the considered distributions,
  which hinders applicability in practice. We propose a new outlier-robust Wasserstein
  distance $\\mathsf{W}_p^\\varepsilon$ which allows for $\\varepsilon$ outlier mass
  to be removed from each contaminated distribution. Under standard moment assumptions,
  $\\mathsf{W}_p^\\varepsilon$ is shown to be minimax optimal for robust estimation
  under the Huber $\\varepsilon$-contamination model. Our formulation of this robust
  distance amounts to a highly regular optimization problem that lends itself better
  for analysis compared to previously considered frameworks. Leveraging this, we conduct
  a thorough theoretical study of $\\mathsf{W}_p^\\varepsilon$, encompassing robustness
  guarantees, characterization of optimal perturbations, regularity, duality, and
  statistical estimation. In particular, by decoupling the optimization variables,
  we arrive at a simple dual form for $\\mathsf{W}_p^\\varepsilon$ that can be implemented
  via an elementary modification to standard, duality-based OT solvers. We illustrate
  the virtues of our framework via applications to generative modeling with contaminated
  datasets. "
