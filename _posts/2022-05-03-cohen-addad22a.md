title: " On Facility Location Problem in the Local Differential Privacy Model "
abstract: " We study the facility location problem under the constraints imposed by
  local differential privacy (LDP). Recently, Gupta et al. (2010) and Esencayi et
  al. (2019) proposed lower and upper bounds for the problem on the central differential
  privacy (DP) model where a trusted curator first collects all data and processes
  it. In this paper, we focus on the LDP model, where we protect a clientâ€™s participation
  in the facility location instance. Under the HST metric, we show that there is a
  non-interactive $\\epsilon$-LDP algorithm achieving $O(n^{1/4}/\\epsilon^2)$-approximation
  ratio, where $n$ is the size of the metric. On the negative side, we show a lower
  bound of $\\Omega(n^{1/4}/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ on the approximation ratio for any
  non-interactive $\\epsilon$-LDP algorithm. Thus, our results are tight up to a polynomial
  factor of $\\epsilon$. Moreover, unlike previous results, our results generalize
  to non-uniform facility costs. "
