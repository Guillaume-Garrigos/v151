title: " Confident Least Square Value Iteration with Local Access to a Simulator "
abstract: " Learning with simulators is ubiquitous in mod-ern reinforcement learning
  (RL). The simulatorcan either correspond to a simplified version ofthe real environment
  (such as a physics simulation of a robot arm) or to the environment itself (such
  as in games like Atari and Go). Among algorithms that are provably sample-efficient
  in this setting, most make the unrealistic assumption that all possible environment
  states are known before learning begins, or perform global optimistic planning which
  is computationally inefficient. In this work, we focus on simulation-based RL under
  a more realistic local access protocol, where the state space is unknown and the
  simulator can only be queried at states that have previously been observed (initial
  states and those returned by previous queries). We propose an algorithm named CONFIDENT-LSVI
  based on the template of least-square value iteration. CONFIDENT-LSVI incrementally
  builds a coreset of important states and uses the simulator to revisit them. Assuming
  that the linear function class has low approximation error under the Bell-man optimality
  operator (a.k.a. low inherent Bell-man error), we bound the algorithm performance
  in terms of this error, and show that it is query-and computationally-efficient. "
