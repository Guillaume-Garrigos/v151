title: " Probing GNN Explainers: A Rigorous Theoretical and Empirical Analysis of
  GNN Explanation Methods "
abstract: " As Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly being employed in critical
  real-world applications, several methods have been proposed in recent literature
  to explain the predictions of these models. However, there has been little to no
  work on systematically analyzing the reliability of these methods. Here, we introduce
  the first-ever theoretical analysis of the reliability of state-of-the-art GNN explanation
  methods. More specifically, we theoretically analyze the behavior of various state-of-the-art
  GNN explanation methods with respect to several desirable properties (e.g., faithfulness,
  stability, and fairness preservation) and establish upper bounds on the violation
  of these properties. We also empirically validate our theoretical results using
  extensive experimentation with nine real-world graph datasets. Our empirical results
  further shed light on several interesting insights about the behavior of state-of-the-art
  GNN explanation methods. "
