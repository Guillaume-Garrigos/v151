title: " Adversarially Robust Kernel Smoothing "
abstract: " We propose a scalable robust learning algorithm combining kernel smoothing
  and robust optimization. Our method is motivated by the convex analysis perspective
  of distributionally robust optimization based on probability metrics, such as the
  Wasserstein distance and the maximum mean discrepancy. We adapt the integral operator
  using supremal convolution in convex analysis to form a novel function majorant
  used for enforcing robustness. Our method is simple in form and applies to general
  loss functions and machine learning models. Exploiting a connection with optimal
  transport, we prove theoretical guarantees for certified robustness under distribution
  shift. Furthermore, we report experiments with general machine learning models,
  such as deep neural networks, to demonstrate competitive performance with the state-of-the-art
  certifiable robust learning algorithms based on the Wasserstein distance. "
