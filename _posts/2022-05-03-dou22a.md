title: " Gap-Dependent Bounds for Two-Player Markov Games "
abstract: " As one of the most popular methods in the field of reinforcement learning,
  Q-learning has received increasing attention. Recently, there have been more theoretical
  works on the regret bound of algorithms that belong to the Q-learning class in different
  settings. In this paper, we analyze the cumulative regret when conducting Nash Q-learning
  algorithm on 2-player turn-based stochastic Markov games (2-TBSG), and propose the
  very first gap dependent logarithmic upper bounds in the episodic tabular setting.
  This bound matches the theoretical lower bound only up to a logarithmic term. Furthermore,
  we extend the conclusion to the discounted game setting with infinite horizon and
  propose a similar gap dependent logarithmic regret bound. Also, under the linear
  MDP assumption, we obtain another logarithmic regret for 2-TBSG, in both centralized
  and independent settings. "
