title: " Feature Collapsing for Gaussian Process Variable Ranking "
abstract: " At present, there is no consensus on the most effective way to establish
  feature relevance for Gaussian process models. The most common heuristic, Automatic
  Relevance Determination, has several downsides; many alternate methods incur unacceptable
  computational costs. Existing methods based on sensitivity analysis of the posterior
  predictive distribution are promising, but are heavily biased and show room for
  improvement. This paper proposes Feature Collapsing as a novel method for performing
  GP feature relevance determination in an effective, unbiased, and computationally-inexpensive
  manner compared to existing algorithms. "
