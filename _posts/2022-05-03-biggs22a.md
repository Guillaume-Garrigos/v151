title: " On Margins and Derandomisation in PAC-Bayes "
abstract: " We give a general recipe for derandomising PAC-Bayesian bounds using margins,
  with the critical ingredient being that our randomised predictions concentrate around
  some value. The tools we develop straightforwardly lead to margin bounds for various
  classifiers, including linear prediction—a class that includes boosting and the
  support vector machine—single-hidden-layer neural networks with an unusual erf activation
  function, and deep ReLU networks. Further we extend to partially-derandomised predictors
  where only some of the randomness of our estimators is removed, letting us extend
  bounds to cases where the concentration properties of our estimators are otherwise
  poor. "
