title: " Fast and accurate optimization on the orthogonal manifold without retraction "
abstract: " We consider the problem of minimizing a function over the manifold of
  orthogonal matrices. The majority of algorithms for this problem compute a direction
  in the tangent space, and then use a retraction to move in that direction while
  staying on the manifold. Unfortunately, the numerical computation of retractions
  on the orthogonal manifold always involves some expensive linear algebra operation,
  such as matrix inversion, exponential or square-root. These operations quickly become
  expensive as the dimension of the matrices grows. To bypass this limitation, we
  propose the landing algorithm which does not use retractions. The algorithm is not
  constrained to stay on the manifold but its evolution is driven by a potential energy
  which progressively attracts it towards the manifold. One iteration of the landing
  algorithm only involves matrix multiplications, which makes it cheap compared to
  its retraction counterparts. We provide an analysis of the convergence of the algorithm,
  and demonstrate its promises on large-scale and deep learning problems, where it
  is faster and less prone to numerical errors than retraction-based methods. "
