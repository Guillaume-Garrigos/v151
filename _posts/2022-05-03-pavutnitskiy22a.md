title: " Quadric Hypersurface Intersection for Manifold Learning in Feature Space "
abstract: " The knowledge that data lies close to a particular submanifold of the
  ambient Euclidean space may be useful in a number of ways. For instance, one may
  want to automatically mark any point far away from the submanifold as an outlier
  or to use the geometry to come up with a better distance metric. Manifold learning
  problems are often posed in a very high dimension, e.g. for spaces of images or
  spaces of words. Today, with deep representation learning on the rise in areas such
  as computer vision and natural language processing, many problems of this kind may
  be transformed into problems of moderately high dimension, typically of the order
  of hundreds. Motivated by this, we propose a manifold learning technique suitable
  for moderately high dimension and large datasets. The manifold is learned from the
  training data in the form of an intersection of quadric hypersurfacesâ€”simple but
  expressive objects. At test time, this manifold can be used to introduce a computationally
  efficient outlier score for arbitrary new data points and to improve a given similarity
  metric by incorporating the learned geometric structure into it. "
