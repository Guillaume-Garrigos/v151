title: " Laplacian Constrained Precision Matrix Estimation: Existence and High Dimensional
  Consistency "
abstract: " This paper considers the problem of estimating high dimensional Laplacian
  constrained precision matrices by minimizing Steinâ€™s loss. We obtain a necessary
  and sufficient condition for existence of this estimator, that consists on checking
  whether a certain data dependent graph is connected. We also prove consistency in
  the high dimensional setting under the symmetrized Stein loss. We show that the
  error rate does not depend on the graph sparsity, or other type of structure, and
  that Laplacian constraints are sufficient for high dimensional consistency. Our
  proofs exploit properties of graph Laplacians, the matrix tree theorem, and a characterization
  of the proposed estimator based on effective graph resistances. We validate our
  theoretical claims with numerical experiments. "
