title: " Relational Neural Markov Random Fields "
abstract: " Statistical Relational Learning (SRL) models have attracted significant
  attention due to their ability to model complex data while handling uncertainty.
  However, most of these models have been restricted to discrete domains owing to
  the complexity of inference in continuous domains. In this work, we introduce Relational
  Neural Markov Random Fields (RN-MRFs) that allow handling of complex relational
  hybrid domains, i.e., those that include discrete and continuous quantities, and
  we propose a maximum pseudolikelihood estimation-based learning algorithm with importance
  sampling for training the neural potential parameters. The key advantage of our
  approach is that it makes minimal data distributional assumptions and can seamlessly
  embed human knowledge through potentials or relational rules. Our empirical evaluations
  across diverse domains, such as image processing and relational object mapping,
  demonstrate its practical utility. "
