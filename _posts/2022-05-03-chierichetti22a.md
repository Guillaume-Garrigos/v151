title: " Spectral Robustness for Correlation Clustering Reconstruction in Semi-Adversarial
  Models "
abstract: ' Correlation Clustering is an important clustering problem with many applications.
  We study the reconstruction version of this problem, in which one seeks to reconstruct
  a latent clustering that has been corrupted by random noise and adversarial modifications.
  Concerning the latter, there is a standard "post-adversarial" model in the literature,
  in which adversarial modifications come after the noise. Here, we introduce and
  analyse a "pre-adversarial" model, in which adversarial modifications come before
  the noise. Given an input coming from such a semi-adversarial generative model,
  the goal is to approximately reconstruct with high probability the latent clustering.
  We focus on the case where the hidden clusters have nearly equal size and show the
  following. In the pre-adversarial setting, spectral algorithms are optimal, in the
  sense that they reconstruct all the way to the information-theoretic threshold beyond
  which no reconstruction is possible. This is in contrast to the post-adversarial
  setting, in which their ability to restore the hidden clusters stops before the
  threshold, but the gap is optimally filled by SDP-based algorithms. These results
  highlight a heretofore unknown robustness of spectral algorithms, showing them less
  brittle than previously thought. '
