title: " A Witness Two-Sample Test "
abstract: " The Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) has been the state-of-the-art nonparametric
  test for tackling the two-sample problem. Its statistic is given by the difference
  in expectations of the witness function, a real-valued function defined as a weighted
  sum of kernel evaluations on a set of basis points. Typically the kernel is optimized
  on a training set, and hypothesis testing is performed on a separate test set to
  avoid overfitting (i.e., control type-I error). That is, the test set is used to
  simultaneously estimate the expectations and define the basis points, while the
  training set only serves to select the kernel and is discarded. In this work, we
  propose to use the training data to also define the weights and the basis points
  for better data efficiency. We show that 1) the new test is consistent and has a
  well-controlled type-I error; 2) the optimal witness function is given by a precision-weighted
  mean in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with the kernel; and 3)
  the test power of the proposed test is comparable or exceeds that of the MMD and
  other modern tests, as verified empirically on challenging synthetic and real problems
  (e.g., Higgs data). "
