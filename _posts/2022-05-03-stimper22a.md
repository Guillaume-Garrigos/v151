title: " Resampling Base Distributions of Normalizing Flows "
abstract: " Normalizing flows are a popular class of models for approximating probability
  distributions. However, their invertible nature limits their ability to model target
  distributions whose support have a complex topological structure, such as Boltzmann
  distributions. Several procedures have been proposed to solve this problem but many
  of them sacrifice invertibility and, thereby, tractability of the log-likelihood
  as well as other desirable properties. To address these limitations, we introduce
  a base distribution for normalizing flows based on learned rejection sampling, allowing
  the resulting normalizing flow to model complicated distributions without giving
  up bijectivity. Furthermore, we develop suitable learning algorithms using both
  maximizing the log-likelihood and the optimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence,
  and apply them to various sample problems, i.e. approximating 2D densities, density
  estimation of tabular data, image generation, and modeling Boltzmann distributions.
  In these experiments our method is competitive with or outperforms the baselines. "
