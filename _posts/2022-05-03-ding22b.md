title: " Kantorovich Mechanism for Pufferfish Privacy "
abstract: " Pufferfish privacy achieves $\\epsilon$-indistinguishability over a set
  of secret pairs in the disclosed data. This paper studies how to attain $\\epsilon$-pufferfish
  privacy by exponential mechanism, an additive noise scheme that generalizes the
  Laplace noise. It is shown that the disclosed data is $\\epsilon$-pufferfish private
  if the noise is calibrated to the sensitivity of the Kantorovich optimal transport
  plan. Such a plan can be obtained directly from the data statistics conditioned
  on the secret, the prior knowledge of the system. The sufficient condition is further
  relaxed to reduce the noise power. It is also proved that the Gaussian mechanism
  based on the Kantorovich approach attains the $\\delta$-approximation of $\\epsilon$-pufferfish
  privacy. "
