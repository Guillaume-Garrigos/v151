title: " An Unsupervised Hunt for Gravitational Lenses "
abstract: ' Strong gravitational lenses allow us to peer into the farthest reaches
  of space by bending the light from a background object around a massive object in
  the foreground. Unfortunately, these lenses are extremely rare, and manually finding
  them in astronomy surveys is difficult and time-consuming. We are thus tasked with
  finding them in an automated fashion with few, if any, known lenses to form positive
  samples. To assist us with training, we can simulate realistic lenses within our
  survey images to form positive samples. Naively training a ResNet model with these
  simulated lenses results in a poor precision for the desired high recall, because
  the simulations contain artifacts that are learned by the model. In this work, we
  develop a lens detection method that combines simulation, data augmentation, semi-supervised
  learning, and GANs to improve this performance by an order of magnitude. We perform
  ablation studies and examine how performance scales with the number of non-lenses
  and simulated lenses. These findings allow researchers to go into a survey mostly
  "blind" and still be able to classify strong gravitational lenses with high precision
  and recall. '
