title: " Many processors, little time: MCMC for partitions via optimal transport couplings "
abstract: ' Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are often used in clustering since
  they guarantee asymptotically exact expectations in the infinite-time limit. In
  finite time, though, slow mixing often leads to poor performance. Modern computing
  environments offer massive parallelism, but naive implementations of parallel MCMC
  can exhibit substantial bias. In MCMC samplers of continuous random variables, Markov
  chain couplings can overcome bias. But these approaches depend crucially on paired
  chains meetings after a small number of transitions. We show that straightforward
  applications of existing coupling ideas to discrete clustering variables fail to
  meet quickly. This failure arises from the "label-switching problem": semantically
  equivalent cluster relabelings impede fast meeting of coupled chains. We instead
  consider chains as exploring the space of partitions rather than partitionsâ€™ (arbitrary)
  labelings. Using a metric on the partition space, we formulate a practical algorithm
  using optimal transport couplings. Our theory confirms our method is accurate and
  efficient. In experiments ranging from clustering of genes or seeds to graph colorings,
  we show the benefits of our coupling in the highly parallel, time-limited regime. '
