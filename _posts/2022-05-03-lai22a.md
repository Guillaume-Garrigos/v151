title: " Variational Marginal Particle Filters "
abstract: " Variational inference for state space models (SSMs) is known to be hard
  in general. Recent works focus on deriving variational objectives for SSMs from
  unbiased sequential Monte Carlo estimators. We reveal that the marginal particle
  filter is obtained from sequential Monte Carlo by applying Rao-Blackwellization
  operations, which sacrifices the trajectory information for reduced variance and
  differentiability. We propose the variational marginal particle filter (VMPF), which
  is a differentiable and reparameterizable variational filtering objective for SSMs
  based on an unbiased estimator. We find that VMPF with biased gradients gives tighter
  bounds than previous objectives, and the unbiased reparameterization gradients are
  sometimes beneficial. "
