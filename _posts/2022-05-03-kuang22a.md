title: " Firebolt: Weak Supervision Under Weaker Assumptions "
abstract: " Modern machine learning demands a large amount of training data. Weak
  supervision is a promising approach to meet this demand. It aggregates multiple
  labeling functions (LFs)–noisy, user-provided labeling heuristics—to rapidly and
  cheaply curate probabilistic labels for large-scale unlabeled data. However, standard
  assumptions in weak supervision—such as user-specified class balance, similar accuracy
  of an LF in classifying different classes, and full knowledge of LF dependency at
  inference time—might be undesirable in practice. In response, we present Firebolt,
  a new weak supervision framework that seeks to operate under weaker assumptions.
  In particular, Firebolt learns the class balance and class-specific accuracy of
  LFs jointly from unlabeled data. It carries out inference in an efficient and interpretable
  manner. We analyze the parameter estimation error of Firebolt and characterize its
  impact on downstream model performance. Furthermore, we show that on five publicly
  available datasets, Firebolt outperforms a state-of-the-art weak supervision method
  by up to 5.8 points in AUC. We also provide a case study in the production setting
  of a tech company, where a Firebolt-supervised model outperforms the existing weakly-supervised
  production model by 1.3 points in AUC and speedup label model training and inference
  from one hour to three minutes. "
