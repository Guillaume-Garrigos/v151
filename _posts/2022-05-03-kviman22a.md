title: " Multiple Importance Sampling ELBO and Deep Ensembles of Variational Approximations "
abstract: " In variational inference (VI), the marginal log-likelihood is estimated
  using the standard evidence lower bound (ELBO), or improved versions as the importance
  weighted ELBO (IWELBO). We propose the multiple importance sampling ELBO (MISELBO),
  a versatile yet simple framework. MISELBO is applicable in both amortized and classical
  VI, and it uses ensembles, e.g., deep ensembles, of independently inferred variational
  approximations. As far as we are aware, the concept of deep ensembles in amortized
  VI has not previously been established. We prove that MISELBO provides a tighter
  bound than the average of standard ELBOs, and demonstrate empirically that it gives
  tighter bounds than the average of IWELBOs. MISELBO is evaluated in density-estimation
  experiments that include MNIST and several real-data phylogenetic tree inference
  problems. First, on the MNIST dataset, MISELBO boosts the density-estimation performances
  of a state-of-the-art model, nouveau VAE. Second, in the phylogenetic tree inference
  setting, our framework enhances a state-of-the-art VI algorithm that uses normalizing
  flows. On top of the technical benefits of MISELBO, it allows to unveil connections
  between VI and recent advances in the importance sampling literature, paving the
  way for further methodological advances. We provide our code at https://github.com/Lagergren-Lab/MISELBO. "
