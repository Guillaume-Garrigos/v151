title: " Increasing the accuracy and resolution of precipitation forecasts using deep
  generative models "
abstract: " Accurately forecasting extreme rainfall is notoriously difficult, but
  is also ever more crucial for society as climate change increases the frequency
  of such extremes. Global numerical weather prediction models often fail to capture
  extremes, and are produced at too low a resolution to be actionable, while regional,
  high-resolution models are hugely expensive both in computation and labour. In this
  paper we explore the use of deep generative models to simultaneously correct and
  downscale (super-resolve) global ensemble forecasts over the Continental US. Specifically,
  using fine-grained radar observations as our ground truth, we train a conditional
  Generative Adversarial Network—coined CorrectorGAN—via a custom training procedure
  and augmented loss function, to produce ensembles of high-resolution, bias-corrected
  forecasts based on coarse, global precipitation forecasts in addition to other relevant
  meteorological fields. Our model outperforms an interpolation baseline, as well
  as super-resolution-only and CNN-based univariate methods, and approaches the performance
  of an operational regional high-resolution model across an array of established
  probabilistic metrics. Crucially, CorrectorGAN, once trained, produces predictions
  in seconds on a single machine. These results raise exciting questions about the
  necessity of regional models, and whether data-driven downscaling and correction
  methods can be transferred to data-poor regions that so far have had no access to
  high-resolution forecasts. "
