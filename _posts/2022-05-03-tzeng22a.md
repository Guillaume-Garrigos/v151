title: " Improved analysis of randomized SVD for top-eigenvector approximation "
abstract: " Computing the top eigenvectors of a matrix is a problem of fundamental
  interest to various fields. While the majority of the literature has focused on
  analyzing the reconstruction error of low-rank matrices associated with the retrieved
  eigenvectors, in many applications one is interested in finding one vector with
  high Rayleigh quotient. In this paper we study the problem of approximating the
  top-eigenvector. Given a symmetric matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ with largest eigenvalue
  $\\lambda_1$, our goal is to find a vector $\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}$ that approximates
  the leading eigenvector $\\mathbf{u}_1$ with high accuracy, as measured by the ratio
  $R(\\hat{\\mathbf{u}})=\\lambda_1^{-1}{\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}^T\\mathbf{A}\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}}/{\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}^T\\hat{\\mathbf{u}}}$.
  We present a novel analysis of the randomized SVD algorithm of \\citet{halko2011finding}
  and derive tight bounds in many cases of interest. Notably, this is the first work
  that provides non-trivial bounds of $R(\\hat{\\mathbf{u}})$ for randomized SVD with
  any number of iterations. Our theoretical analysis is complemented with a thorough
  experimental study that confirms the efficiency and accuracy of the method. "
