title: " A Bayesian Model for Online Activity Sample Sizes "
abstract: " In many contexts it is useful to predict the number of individuals in
  some population who will initiate a particular activity during a given period. For
  example, the number of users who will install a software update, the number of customers
  who will use a new feature on a website or who will participate in an A/B test.
  In practical settings, there is heterogeneity amongst individuals with regard to
  the distribution of time until they will initiate. For these reasons it is inappropriate
  to assume that the number of new individuals observed on successive days will be
  identically distributed. Given observations on the number of unique users participating
  in an initial period, we present a simple but novel Bayesian method for predicting
  the number of additional individuals who will participate during a subsequent period.
  We illustrate the performance of the method in predicting sample size in online
  experimentation. "
