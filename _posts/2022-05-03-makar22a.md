title: " Causally motivated shortcut removal using auxiliary labels "
abstract: " Shortcut learning, in which models make use of easy-to-represent but unstable
  associations, is a major failure mode for robust machine learning. We study a flexible,
  causally-motivated approach to training robust predictors by discouraging the use
  of specific shortcuts, focusing on a common setting where a robust predictor could
  achieve optimal i.i.d generalization in principle, but is overshadowed by a shortcut
  predictor in practice. Our approach uses auxiliary labels, typically available at
  training time, to enforce conditional independences implied by the causal graph.
  We show both theoretically and empirically that causally-motivated regularization
  schemes (a) lead to more robust estimators that generalize well under distribution
  shift, and (b) have better finite sample efficiency compared to usual regularization
  schemes, even when no shortcut is present. Our analysis highlights important theoretical
  properties of training techniques commonly used in the causal inference, fairness,
  and disentanglement literatures. Our code is available at github.com/mymakar/causally_motivated_shortcut_removal "
