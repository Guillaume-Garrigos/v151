title: " Permutation Equivariant Layers for Higher Order Interactions "
abstract: " Recent work on permutation equivariant neural networks has mostly focused
  on the first order case (sets) and second order case (graphs). We describe the machinery
  for generalizing permutation equivariance to arbitrary $k$-ary interactions between
  entities for any value of $k$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of higher order
  permutation equivariant models on several real world applications and find that
  our results compare favorably to existing permutation invariant/equivariant baselines. "
