title: " Optimal Design of Stochastic DNA Synthesis Protocols based on Generative
  Sequence Models "
abstract: " Generative probabilistic models of biological sequences have widespread
  existing and potential applications in analyzing, predicting and designing proteins,
  RNA and genomes. To test the predictions of such a model experimentally, the standard
  approach is to draw samples, and then synthesize each sample individually in the
  laboratory. However, often orders of magnitude more sequences can be experimentally
  assayed than can be affordably synthesized individually. In this article, we propose
  instead to use stochastic synthesis methods, such as mixed nucleotides or trimers.
  We describe a black-box algorithm for optimizing stochastic synthesis protocols
  to produce approximate samples from any target generative model. We establish theoretical
  bounds on the methodâ€™s performance, and validate it in simulation using held-out
  sequence-to-function predictors trained on real experimental data. We show that
  using optimized stochastic synthesis protocols in place of individual synthesis
  can increase the number of hits in protein engineering efforts by orders of magnitude,
  e.g. from zero to a thousand. "
