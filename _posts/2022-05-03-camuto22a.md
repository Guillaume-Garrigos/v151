title: " Variational Autoencoders: A Harmonic Perspective "
abstract: " In this work we study Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) from the perspective
  of harmonic analysis. By viewing a VAEâ€™s latent space as a Gaussian Space, a variety
  of measure space, we derive a series of results that show that the encoder variance
  of a VAE controls the frequency content of the functions parameterised by the VAE
  encoder and decoder neural networks. In particular we demonstrate that larger encoder
  variances reduce the high frequency content of these functions. Our analysis allows
  us to show that increasing this variance effectively induces a soft Lipschitz constraint
  on the decoder network of a VAE, which is a core contributor to the adversarial
  robustness of VAEs. We further demonstrate that adding Gaussian noise to the input
  of a VAE allows us to more finely control the frequency content and the Lipschitz
  constant of the VAE encoder networks. Finally, we show that the KL term of the VAE
  loss serves as single point of action for modulating the frequency content of both
  encoder and decoder networks; whereby upweighting this term decreases the high-frequency
  content of both networks. To support our theoretical analysis we run experiments
  using VAEs with small fully-connected neural networks and with larger convolutional
  networks, demonstrating empirically that our theory holds for a variety of neural
  network architectures. "
