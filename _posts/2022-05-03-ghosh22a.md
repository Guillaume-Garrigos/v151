title: " Differentiable Bayesian inference of SDE parameters using a pathwise series
  expansion of Brownian motion "
abstract: " By invoking a pathwise series expansion of Brownian motion, we propose
  to approximate a stochastic differential equation (SDE) with an ordinary differential
  equation (ODE). This allows us to reformulate Bayesian inference for a SDE as the
  parameter estimation task for an ODE. Unlike a nonlinear SDE, the likelihood for
  an ODE model is tractable and its gradient can be obtained using adjoint sensitivity
  analysis. This reformulation allows us to use an efficient sampler, such as NUTS,
  that rely on the gradient of the log posterior. Applying the reparameterisation
  trick, variational inference can also be used for the same estimation task. We illustrate
  the proposed method on a variety of SDE models. We obtain similar parameter estimates
  when compared to data augmentation techniques. "
