title: " Top K Ranking for Multi-Armed Bandit with Noisy Evaluations "
abstract: " We consider a multi-armed bandit setting where, at the beginning of each
  round, the learner receives noisy independent, and possibly biased, evaluations
  of the true reward of each arm and it selects $K$ arms with the objective of accumulating
  as much reward as possible over $T$ rounds. Under the assumption that at each round
  the true reward of each arm is drawn from a fixed distribution, we derive different
  algorithmic approaches and theoretical guarantees depending on how the evaluations
  are generated. First, we show a $\\widetilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret in the general
  case when the observation functions are a genearalized linear function of the true
  rewards. On the other hand, we show that an improved $\\widetilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$
  regret can be derived when the observation functions are noisy linear functions
  of the true rewards. Finally, we report an empirical validation that confirms our
  theoretical findings, provides a thorough comparison to alternative approaches,
  and further supports the interest of this setting in practice. "
