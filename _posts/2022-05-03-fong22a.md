title: " A Predictive Approach to Bayesian Nonparametric Survival Analysis "
abstract: " Bayesian nonparametric methods are a popular choice for analysing survival
  data due to their ability to flexibly model the distribution of survival times.
  These methods typically employ a nonparametric prior on the survival function that
  is conjugate with respect to right-censored data. Eliciting these priors, particularly
  in the presence of covariates, can be challenging and inference typically relies
  on computationally intensive Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes. In this paper, we
  build on recent work that recasts Bayesian inference as assigning a predictive distribution
  on the unseen values of a population conditional on the observed samples, thus avoiding
  the need to specify a complex prior. We describe a copula-based predictive update
  which admits a scalable sequential importance sampling algorithm to perform inference
  that properly accounts for right-censoring. We provide theoretical justification
  through an extension of Doobâ€™s consistency theorem and illustrate the method on
  a number of simulated and real data sets, including an example with covariates.
  Our approach enables analysts to perform Bayesian nonparametric inference through
  only the specification of a predictive distribution. "
