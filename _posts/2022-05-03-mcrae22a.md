title: " Harmless interpolation in regression and classification with structured features "
abstract: " Overparametrized neural networks tend to perfectly fit noisy training
  data yet generalize well on test data. Inspired by this empirical observation, recent
  work has sought to understand this phenomenon of benign overfitting or harmless
  interpolation in the much simpler linear model. Previous theoretical work critically
  assumes that either the data features are statistically independent or the input
  data is high-dimensional; this precludes general nonparametric settings with structured
  feature maps. In this paper, we present a general and flexible framework for upper
  bounding regression and classification risk in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.
  A key contribution is that our framework describes precise sufficient conditions
  on the data Gram matrix under which harmless interpolation occurs. Our results recover
  prior independent-features results (with a much simpler analysis), but they furthermore
  show that harmless interpolation can occur in more general settings such as features
  that are a bounded orthonormal system. Furthermore, our results show an asymptotic
  separation between classification and regression performance in a manner that was
  previously only shown for Gaussian features. "
