title: " Convergence of Langevin Monte Carlo in Chi-Squared and Rényi Divergence "
abstract: " We study sampling from a target distribution $\\nu_* = e^{-f}$ using the
  unadjusted Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm when the potential $f$ satisfies
  a strong dissipativity condition and it is first-order smooth with a Lipschitz gradient.
  We prove that, initialized with a Gaussian random vector that has sufficiently small
  variance, iterating the LMC algorithm for $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\lambda^2
  d\\epsilon^{-1})$ steps is sufficient to reach $\\epsilon$-neighborhood of the target
  in both Chi-squared and Rényi divergence, where $\\lambda$ is the logarithmic Sobolev
  constant of $\\nu_*$. Our results do not require warm-start to deal with the exponential
  dimension dependency in Chi-squared divergence at initialization. In particular,
  for strongly convex and first-order smooth potentials, we show that the LMC algorithm
  achieves the rate estimate $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d\\epsilon^{-1})$ which improves
  the previously known rates in both of these metrics, under the same assumptions.
  Translating this rate to other metrics, our results also recover the state-of-the-art
  rate estimates in KL divergence, total variation and $2$-Wasserstein distance in
  the same setup. Finally, as we rely on the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, our framework
  covers a range of non-convex potentials that are first-order smooth and exhibit
  strong convexity outside of a compact region. "
