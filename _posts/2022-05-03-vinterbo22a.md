title: " Differential privacy for symmetric log-concave mechanisms "
abstract: " Adding random noise to database query results is an important tool for
  achieving privacy. A challenge is to minimize this noise while still meeting privacy
  requirements. Recently, a sufficient and necessary condition for $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differential
  privacy for Gaussian noise was published. This condition allows the computation
  of the minimum privacy-preserving scale for this distribution. We extend this work
  and provide a sufficient and necessary condition for $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differential
  privacy for all symmetric and log-concave noise densities. Our results allow fine-grained
  tailoring of the noise distribution to the dimensionality of the query result. We
  demonstrate that this can yield significantly lower mean squared errors than those
  incurred by the currently used Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms for the same $\\epsilon$
  and $\\delta$. "
