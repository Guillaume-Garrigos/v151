title: " Common Failure Modes of Subcluster-based Sampling in Dirichlet Process Gaussian
  Mixture Models - and a Deep-learning Solution "
abstract: " The Dirichlet Process Gaussian Mixture Model (DPGMM) is often used to
  cluster data when the number of clusters is unknown. One main DPGMM inference paradigm
  relies on sampling. Here we consider a known state-of-art sampler (proposed by Chang
  and Fisher III (2013) and improved byÂ Dinari et al. (2019)), analyze its failure
  modes, and show how to improve it, often drastically. Concretely, in that sampler,
  whenever a new cluster is formed it is augmented with two subclusters whose labels
  are initialized at random. Upon their evolution, the subclusters serve to propose
  a split of the parent cluster. We show that the random initialization is often problematic
  and hurts the otherwise-effective sampler. Specifically, we demonstrate that this
  initialization tends to lead to poor split proposals and/or too many iterations
  before a desired split is accepted. This slows convergence and can damage the clustering.
  As a remedy, we propose two drop-in-replacement options for the subcluster-initialization
  subroutine. The first is an intuitive heuristic while the second is based on deep
  learning. We show that the proposed approach yields better splits, which in turn
  translate to substantial improvements in performance, results, and stability. Our
  code is publicly available. "
