title: " MT3: Meta Test-Time Training for Self-Supervised Test-Time Adaption "
abstract: " An unresolved problem in Deep Learning is the ability of neural networks
  to cope with domain shifts during test-time, imposed by commonly fixing network
  parameters after training. Our proposed method Meta Test-Time Training (MT3), however,
  breaks this paradigm and enables adaption at test-time. We combine meta-learning,
  self-supervision and test-time training to learn to adapt to unseen test distributions.
  By minimizing the self-supervised loss, we learn task-specific model parameters
  for different tasks. A meta-model is optimized such that its adaption to the different
  task-specific models leads to higher performance on those tasks. During test-time
  a single unlabeled image is sufficient to adapt the meta-model parameters. This
  is achieved by minimizing only the self-supervised loss component resulting in a
  better prediction for that image. Our approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art
  results on the CIFAR-10-Corrupted image classification benchmark. "
