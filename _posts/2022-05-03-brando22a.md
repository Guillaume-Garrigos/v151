title: " Deep Non-crossing Quantiles through the Partial Derivative "
abstract: " Quantile Regression (QR) provides a way to approximate a single conditional
  quantile. To have a more informative description of the conditional distribution,
  QR can be merged with deep learning techniques to simultaneously estimate multiple
  quantiles. However, the minimisation of the QR-loss function does not guarantee
  non-crossing quantiles, which affects the validity of such predictions and introduces
  a critical issue in certain scenarios. In this article, we propose a generic deep
  learning algorithm for predicting an arbitrary number of quantiles that ensures
  the quantile monotonicity constraint up to the machine precision and maintains its
  modelling performance with respect to alternative models. The presented method is
  evaluated over several real-world datasets obtaining state-of-the-art results as
  well as showing that it scales to large-size data sets. "
