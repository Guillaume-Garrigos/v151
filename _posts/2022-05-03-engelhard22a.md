title: " Disentangling Whether from When in a Neural Mixture Cure Model for Failure
  Time Data "
abstract: " The mixture cure model allows failure probability to be estimated separately
  from failure timing in settings wherein failure never occurs in a subset of the
  population. In this paper, we draw on insights from representation learning and
  causal inference to develop a neural network based mixture cure model that is free
  of distributional assumptions, yielding improved prediction of failure timing, yet
  still effectively disentangles information about failure timing from information
  about failure probability. Our approach also mitigates effects of selection biases
  in the observation of failure and censoring times on estimation of the failure density
  and censoring density, respectively. Results suggest this approach could be applied
  to distinguish factors predicting failure occurrence versus timing and mitigate
  biases in real-world observational datasets. "
