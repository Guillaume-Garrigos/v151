title: " ExactBoost: Directly Boosting the Margin in Combinatorial and Non-decomposable
  Metrics "
abstract: " Many classification algorithms require the use of surrogate losses when
  the intended loss function is combinatorial or non-decomposable. This paper introduces
  a fast and exact stagewise optimization algorithm, dubbed ExactBoost, that boosts
  stumps to the actual loss function. By developing a novel extension of margin theory
  to the non-decomposable setting, it is possible to provably bound the generalization
  error of ExactBoost for many important metrics with different levels of non-decomposability.
  Through extensive examples, it is shown that such theoretical guarantees translate
  to competitive empirical performance. In particular, when used as an ensembler,
  ExactBoost is able to significantly outperform other surrogate-based and exact algorithms
  available. "
