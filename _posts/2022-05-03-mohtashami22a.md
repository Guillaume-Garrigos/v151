title: " Masked Training of Neural Networks with Partial Gradients "
abstract: " State-of-the-art training algorithms for deep learning models are based
  on stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Recently, many variations have been explored:
  perturbing parameters for better accuracy (such as in Extragradient), limiting SGD
  updates to a subset of parameters for increased efficiency (such as meProp) or a
  combination of both (such as Dropout). However, the convergence of these methods
  is often not studied in theory. We propose a unified theoretical framework to study
  such SGD variantsâ€”encompassing the aforementioned algorithms and additionally a
  broad variety of methods used for communication efficient training or model compression.
  Our insights can be used as a guide to improve the efficiency of such methods and
  facilitate generalization to new applications. As an example, we tackle the task
  of jointly training networks, a version of which (limited to sub-networks) is used
  to create Slimmable Networks. By training a low-rank Transformer jointly with a
  standard one we obtain superior performance than when it is trained separately. "
