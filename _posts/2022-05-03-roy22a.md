title: " On Some Fast And Robust Classifiers For High Dimension, Low Sample Size Data "
abstract: " In high dimension, low sample size (HDLSS) settings, distance concentration
  phenomena affects the performance of several popular classifiers which are based
  on Euclidean distances. The behaviour of these classifiers in high dimensions is
  completely governed by the first and second order moments of the underlying class
  distributions. Moreover, the classifiers become useless for such HDLSS data when
  the first two moments of the competing distributions are equal, or when the moments
  do not exist. In this work, we propose robust, computationally efficient and tuning-free
  classifiers applicable in the HDLSS scenario. As the data dimension increases, these
  classifiers yield perfect classification if the one-dimensional marginals of the
  underlying distributions are different. We establish strong theoretical properties
  for the proposed classifiers in ultrahigh-dimensional settings. Numerical experiments
  with a wide variety of simulated examples and analysis of real data sets exhibit
  clear and convincing advantages over existing methods. "
