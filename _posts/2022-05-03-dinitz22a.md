title: " Fair Disaster Containment via Graph-Cut Problems "
abstract: " Graph cut problems are fundamental in combinatorial Optimization, and
  are a central object of study in both theory and practice. Further, the study of
  fairness in Algorithmic Design and Machine Learning has recently received significant
  attention, with many different notions proposed and analyzed for a variety of contexts.
  In this paper we initiate the study of fairness for graph cut problems by giving
  the first fair definitions for them, and subsequently we demonstrate appropriate
  algorithmic techniques that yield a rigorous theoretical analysis. Specifically,
  we incorporate two different notions of fairness, namely demographic and probabilistic
  individual fairness, in a particular cut problem that models disaster containment
  scenarios. Our results include a variety of approximation algorithms with provable
  theoretical guarantees. "
