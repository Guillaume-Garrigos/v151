title: " Sample Complexity of Robust Reinforcement Learning with a Generative Model "
abstract: " The Robust Markov Decision Process (RMDP) framework focuses on designing
  control policies that are robust against the parameter uncertainties due to the
  mismatches between the simulator model and real-world settings. An RMDP problem
  is typically formulated as a max-min problem, where the objective is to find the
  policy that maximizes the value function for the worst possible model that lies
  in an uncertainty set around a nominal model. The standard robust dynamic programming
  approach requires the knowledge of the nominal model for computing the optimal robust
  policy. In this work, we propose a model-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm
  for learning an $\\epsilon$-optimal robust policy when the nominal model is unknown.
  We consider three different forms of uncertainty sets, characterized by the total
  variation distance, chi-square divergence, and KL divergence. For each of these
  uncertainty sets, we give a precise characterization of the sample complexity of
  our proposed algorithm. In addition to the sample complexity results, we also present
  a formal analytical argument on the benefit of using robust policies. Finally, we
  demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on two benchmark problems. "
