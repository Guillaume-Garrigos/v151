title: " Infinitely Deep Bayesian Neural Networks with Stochastic Differential Equations "
abstract: " We perform scalable approximate inference in continuous-depth Bayesian
  neural networks. In this model class, uncertainty about separate weights in each
  layer gives hidden units that follow a stochastic differential equation. We demonstrate
  gradient-based stochastic variational inference in this infinite-parameter setting,
  producing arbitrarily-flexible approximate posteriors. We also derive a novel gradient
  estimator that approaches zero variance as the approximate posterior over weights
  approaches the true posterior. This approach brings continuous-depth Bayesian neural
  nets to a competitive comparison against discrete-depth alternatives, while inheriting
  the memory-efficient training and tunable precision of Neural ODEs. "
