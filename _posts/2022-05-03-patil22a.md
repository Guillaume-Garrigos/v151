title: " Estimating Functionals of the Out-of-Sample Error Distribution in High-Dimensional
  Ridge Regression "
abstract: " We study the problem of estimating the distribution of the out-of-sample
  prediction error associated with ridge regression. In contrast, the traditional
  object of study is the uncentered second moment of this distribution (the mean squared
  prediction error), which can be estimated using cross-validation methods. We show
  that both generalized and leave-one-out cross-validation (GCV and LOOCV) for ridge
  regression can be suitably extended to estimate the full error distribution. This
  is still possible in a high-dimensional setting where the ridge regularization parameter
  is zero. In an asymptotic framework in which the feature dimension and sample size
  grow proportionally, we prove that almost surely, with respect to the training data,
  our estimators (extensions of GCV and LOOCV) converge weakly to the true out-of-sample
  error distribution. This result requires mild assumptions on the response and feature
  distributions. We also establish a more general result that allows us to estimate
  certain functionals of the error distribution, both linear and nonlinear. This yields
  various applications, including consistent estimation of the quantiles of the out-of-sample
  error distribution, which gives rise to prediction intervals with asymptotically
  exact coverage conditional on the training data. "
