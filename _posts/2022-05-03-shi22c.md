title: " A Bayesian Approach for Stochastic Continuum-armed Bandit with Long-term
  Constraints "
abstract: " Despite many valuable advances in the domain of online convex optimization
  over the last decade, many machine learning and networking problems of interest
  do not fit into that framework due to their nonconvex objectives and the presence
  of constraints. This motivates us in this paper to go beyond convexity and study
  the problem of stochastic continuum-armed bandit with long-term constraints. For
  noiseless observations of constraint functions, we propose a generic method using
  a Bayesian approach based on a class of penalty functions, and prove that it can
  achieve a sublinear regret with respect to the global optimum and a sublinear constraint
  violation (CV), which can match the best results of previous methods. Additionally,
  we propose another method to deal with the case where constraint functions are observed
  with noise, which can achieve a sublinear regret and a sublinear CV with more assumptions.
  Finally, we use two experiments to compare our methods with two benchmark methods
  in online optimization and Bayesian optimization, which demonstrates the advantages
  of our algorithms. "
