title: " A Single-Timescale Method for Stochastic Bilevel Optimization "
abstract: " Stochastic bilevel optimization generalizes the classic stochastic optimization
  from the minimization of a single objective to the minimization of an objective
  function that depends on the solution of another optimization problem. Recently,
  bilevel optimization is regaining popularity in emerging machine learning applications
  such as hyper-parameter optimization and model-agnostic meta learning. To solve
  this class of optimization problems, existing methods require either double-loop
  or two-timescale updates, which are sometimes less efficient. This paper develops
  a new optimization method for a class of stochastic bilevel problems that we term
  Single-Timescale stochAstic BiLevEl optimization (STABLE) method. STABLE runs in
  a single loop fashion, and uses a single-timescale update with a fixed batch size.
  To achieve an $\\epsilon$-stationary point of the bilevel problem, STABLE requires
  ${\\cal O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ samples in total; and to achieve an $\\epsilon$-optimal
  solution in the strongly convex case, STABLE requires ${\\cal O}(\\epsilon^{-1})$
  samples. To the best of our knowledge, when STABLE was proposed, it is the first
  bilevel optimization algorithm achieving the same order of sample complexity as
  SGD for single-level stochastic optimization. "
