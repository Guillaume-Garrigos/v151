title: " Distributed Sparse Multicategory Discriminant Analysis "
abstract: " This paper proposes a convex formulation for sparse multicategory linear
  discriminant analysis and then extend it to the distributed setting when data are
  stored across multiple sites. The key observation is that for the purpose of classification
  it suffices to recover the discriminant subspace which is invariant to orthogonal
  transformations. Theoretically, we establish statistical properties ensuring that
  the distributed sparse multicategory linear discriminant analysis performs as good
  as the centralized version after a few rounds of communications. Numerical studies
  lend strong support to our methodology and theory. "
