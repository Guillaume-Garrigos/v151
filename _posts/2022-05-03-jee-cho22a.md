title: " Towards Understanding Biased Client Selection in Federated Learning "
abstract: " Federated learning is a distributed optimization paradigm that enables
  a large number of resource-limited client nodes to cooperatively train a model without
  data sharing. Previous works analyzed the convergence of federated learning by accounting
  of data heterogeneity, communication/computation limitations, and partial client
  participation. However, most assume unbiased client participation, where clients
  are selected such that the aggregated model update is unbiased. In our work, we
  present the convergence analysis of federated learning with biased client selection
  and quantify how the bias affects convergence speed. We show that biasing client
  selection towards clients with higher local loss yields faster error convergence.
  From this insight, we propose Power-of-Choice, a communication- and computation-efficient
  client selection framework that flexibly spans the trade-off between convergence
  speed and solution bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Power-of-Choice
  can converge up to 3 times faster and give $10%$ higher test accuracy than the baseline
  random selection. "
