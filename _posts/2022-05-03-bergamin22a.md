title: " Model-agnostic out-of-distribution detection using combined statistical tests "
abstract: " We present simple methods for out-of-distribution detection using a trained
  generative model. These techniques, based on classical statistical tests, are model-agnostic
  in the sense that they can be applied to any differentiable generative model. The
  idea is to combine a classical parametric test (Rao’s score test) with the recently
  introduced typicality test. These two test statistics are both theoretically well-founded
  and exploit different sources of information based on the likelihood for the typicality
  test and its gradient for the score test. We show that combining them using Fisher’s
  method overall leads to a more accurate out-of-distribution test. We also discuss
  the benefits of casting out-of-distribution detection as a statistical testing problem,
  noting in particular that false positive rate control can be valuable for practical
  out-of-distribution detection. Despite their simplicity and generality, these methods
  can be competitive with model-specific out-of-distribution detection algorithms
  without any assumptions on the out-distribution. "
