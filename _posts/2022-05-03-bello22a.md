title: " A View of Exact Inference in Graphs from the Degree-4 Sum-of-Squares Hierarchy "
abstract: " Performing inference in graphs is a common task within several machine
  learning problems, e.g., image segmentation, community detection, among others.
  For a given undirected connected graph, we tackle the statistical problem of exactly
  recovering an unknown ground-truth binary labeling of the nodes from a single corrupted
  observation of each edge. Such problem can be formulated as a quadratic combinatorial
  optimization problem over the boolean hypercube, where it has been shown before
  that one can (with high probability and in polynomial time) exactly recover the
  ground-truth labeling of graphs that have an isoperimetric number that grows with
  respect to the number of nodes (e.g., complete graphs, regular expanders). In this
  work, we apply a powerful hierarchy of relaxations, known as the sum-of-squares
  (SoS) hierarchy, to the combinatorial problem. Motivated by empirical evidence on
  the improvement in exact recoverability, we center our attention on the degree-4
  SoS relaxation and set out to understand the origin of such improvement from a graph
  theoretical perspective. We show that the solution of the dual of the relaxed problem
  is related to finding edge weights of the Johnson and Kneser graphs, where the weights
  fulfill the SoS constraints and intuitively allow the input graph to increase its
  algebraic connectivity. Finally, as byproduct of our analysis, we derive a novel
  Cheeger-type lower bound for the algebraic connectivity of graphs with signed edge
  weights. "
