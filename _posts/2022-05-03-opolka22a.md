title: " Adaptive Gaussian Processes on Graphs via Spectral Graph Wavelets "
abstract: " Graph-based models require aggregating information in the graph from neighbourhoods
  of different sizes. In particular, when the data exhibit varying levels of smoothness
  on the graph, a multi-scale approach is required to capture the relevant information.
  In this work, we propose a Gaussian process model using spectral graph wavelets,
  which can naturally aggregate neighbourhood information at different scales. Through
  maximum likelihood optimisation of the model hyperparameters, the wavelets automatically
  adapt to the different frequencies in the data, and as a result our model goes beyond
  capturing low frequency information. We achieve scalability to larger graphs by
  using a spectrum-adaptive polynomial approximation of the filter function, which
  is designed to yield a low approximation error in dense areas of the graph spectrum.
  Synthetic and real-world experiments demonstrate the ability of our model to infer
  scales accurately and produce competitive performances against state-of-the-art
  models in graph-based learning tasks. "
