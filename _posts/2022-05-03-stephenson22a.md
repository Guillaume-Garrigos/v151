title: " Measuring the robustness of Gaussian processes to kernel choice "
abstract: " Gaussian processes (GPs) are used to make medical and scientific decisions,
  including in cardiac care and monitoring of carbon dioxide emissions. Notably, the
  choice of GP kernel is often somewhat arbitrary. In particular, uncountably many
  kernels typically align with qualitative prior knowledge (e.g. function smoothness
  or stationarity). But in practice, data analysts choose among a handful of convenient
  standard kernels (e.g. squared exponential). In the present work, we ask: Would
  decisions made with a GP differ under other, qualitatively interchangeable kernels?
  We show how to formulate this sensitivity analysis as a constrained optimization
  problem over a finite-dimensional space. We can then use standard optimizers to
  identify substantive changes in relevant decisions made with a GP. We demonstrate
  in both synthetic and real-world examples that decisions made with a GP can exhibit
  substantial sensitivity to kernel choice, even when prior draws are qualitatively
  interchangeable to a user. "
