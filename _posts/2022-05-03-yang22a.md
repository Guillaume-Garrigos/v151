title: " Offline Policy Selection under Uncertainty "
abstract: " The presence of uncertainty in policy evaluation significantly complicates
  the process of policy ranking and selection in real-world settings. We formally
  consider offline policy selection as learning preferences over a set of policy prospects
  given a fixed experience dataset. While one can select or rank policies based on
  point estimates of their expected values or high-confidence intervals, access to
  the full distribution over oneâ€™s belief of the policy value enables more flexible
  selection algorithms under a wider range of downstream evaluation metrics. We propose
  a Bayesian approach for estimating this belief distribution in terms of posteriors
  of distribution correction ratios derived from stochastic constraints. Empirically,
  despite being Bayesian, the credible intervals obtained are competitive with state-of-the-art
  frequentist approaches in confidence interval estimation. More importantly, we show
  how the belief distribution may be used to rank policies with respect to arbitrary
  downstream policy selection metrics, and empirically demonstrate that this selection
  procedure significantly outperforms existing approaches, such as ranking policies
  according to mean or high-confidence lower bound value estimates. "
