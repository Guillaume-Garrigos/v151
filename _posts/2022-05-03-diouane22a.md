title: " A Globally Convergent Evolutionary Strategy for Stochastic Constrained Optimization
  with Applications to Reinforcement Learning "
abstract: " Evolutionary strategies have recently been shown to achieve competing
  levels of performance for complex optimization problems in reinforcement learning.
  In such problems, one often needs to optimize an objective function subject to a
  set of constraints, including for instance constraints on the entropy of a policy
  or to restrict the possible set of actions or states accessible to an agent. Convergence
  guarantees for evolutionary strategies to optimize stochastic constrained problems
  are however lacking in the literature. In this work, we address this problem by
  designing a novel optimization algorithm with a sufficient decrease mechanism that
  ensures convergence and that is based only on estimates of the functions. We demonstrate
  the applicability of this algorithm on two types of experiments: i) a control task
  for maximizing rewards and ii) maximizing rewards subject to a non-relaxable set
  of constraints. "
