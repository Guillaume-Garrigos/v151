title: " Mitigating Bias in Calibration Error Estimation "
abstract: " For an AI system to be reliable, the confidence it expresses in its decisions
  must match its accuracy. To assess the degree of match, examples are typically binned
  by confidence and the per-bin mean confidence and accuracy are compared. Most research
  in calibration focuses on techniques to reduce this empirical measure of calibration
  error, ECE_bin. We instead focus on assessing statistical bias in this empirical
  measure, and we identify better estimators. We propose a framework through which
  we can compute the bias of a particular estimator for an evaluation data set of
  a given size. The framework involves synthesizing model outputs that have the same
  statistics as common neural architectures on popular data sets. We find that binning-based
  estimators with bins of equal mass (number of instances) have lower bias than estimators
  with bins of equal width. Our results indicate two reliable calibration-error estimators:
  the debiased estimator (Brocker, 2012; Ferro and Fricker, 2012) and a method we
  propose, ECE_sweep, which uses equal-mass bins and chooses the number of bins to
  be as large as possible while preserving monotonicity in the calibration function.
  With these estimators, we observe improvements in the effectiveness of recalibration
  methods and in the detection of model miscalibration. "
