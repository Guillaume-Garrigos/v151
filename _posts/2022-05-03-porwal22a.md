title: " Almost Optimal Universal Lower Bound for Learning Causal DAGs with Atomic
  Interventions "
abstract: ' A well-studied challenge that arises in the structure learning problem
  of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAG) is that using observational data, one can
  only learn the graph up to a "Markov equivalence class" (MEC). The remaining undirected
  edges have to be oriented using interventions, which can be very expensive to perform
  in applications. Thus, the problem of minimizing the number of interventions needed
  to fully orient the MEC has received a lot of recent attention, and is also the
  focus of this work. We prove two main results. The first is a new universal lower
  bound on the number of atomic interventions that any algorithm (whether active or
  passive) would need to perform in order to orient a given MEC. Our second result
  shows that this bound is, in fact, within a factor of two of the size of the smallest
  set of atomic interventions that can orient the MEC. Our lower bound is provably
  better than previously known lower bounds. The proof of our lower bound is based
  on the new notion of clique-block shared-parents (CBSP) orderings, which are topological
  orderings of DAGs without v-structures and satisfy certain special properties. Further,
  using simulations on synthetic graphs and by giving examples of special graph families,
  we show that our bound is often significantly better. '
