title: " Approximate Top-$m$ Arm Identification with Heterogeneous Reward Variances "
abstract: " We study the effect of reward variance heterogeneity in the approximate
  top-$m$ arm identification setting. In this setting, the reward for the $i$-th arm
  follows a $\\sigma^2_i$-sub-Gaussian distribution, and the agent needs to incorporate
  this knowledge to minimize the expected number of arm pulls to identify $m$ arms
  with the largest means within error $\\epsilon$ out of the $n$ arms, with probability
  at least $1-\\delta$. We show that the worst-case sample complexity of this problem
  is $$\\Theta\\left( \\sum_{i =1}^n \\frac{\\sigma_i^2}{\\epsilon^2} \\ln\\frac{1}{\\delta}
  + \\sum_{i \\in G^{m}} \\frac{\\sigma_i^2}{\\epsilon^2} \\ln(m) + \\sum_{j \\in
  G^{l}} \\frac{\\sigma_j^2}{\\epsilon^2} \\text{Ent}(\\sigma^2_{G^{r}}) \\right),
  $$where $G^{m}, G^{l}, G^{r}$ are certain specific subsets of the overall arm set
  $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, n\\}$, and $\\text{Ent}(\\cdot)$ is an entropy-like function
  which measures the heterogeneity of the variance proxies. The upper bound of the
  complexity is obtained using a divide-and-conquer style algorithm, while the matching
  lower bound relies on the study of a dual formulation. "
