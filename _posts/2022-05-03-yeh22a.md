title: " Threading the Needle of On and Off-Manifold Value Functions for Shapley Explanations "
abstract: " A popular explainable AI (XAI) approach to quantify feature importance
  of a given model is via Shapley values. These Shapley values arose in cooperative
  games, and hence a critical ingredient to compute these in an XAI context is a so-called
  value function, that computes the “value” of a subset of features, and which connects
  machine learning models to cooperative games. There are many possible choices for
  such value functions, which broadly fall into two categories: on-manifold and off-manifold
  value functions, which take an observational and an interventional viewpoint respectively.
  Both these classes however have their respective flaws, where on-manifold value
  functions violate key axiomatic properties and are computationally expensive, while
  off-manifold value functions pay less heed to the data manifold and evaluate the
  model on regions for which it wasn’t trained. Thus, there is no consensus on which
  class of value functions to use. In this paper, we show that in addition to these
  existing issues, both classes of value functions are prone to adversarial manipulations
  on low density regions. We formalize the desiderata of value functions that respect
  both the model and the data manifold in a set of axioms and are robust to perturbation
  on off-manifold regions, and show that there exists a unique value function that
  satisfies these axioms, which we term the Joint Baseline value function, and the
  resulting Shapley value the Joint Baseline Shapley (JBshap), and validate the effectiveness
  of JBshap in experiments. "
