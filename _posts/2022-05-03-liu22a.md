title: " Grassmann Stein Variational Gradient Descent "
abstract: " Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a deterministic particle
  inference algorithm that provides an efficient alternative to Markov chain Monte
  Carlo. However, SVGD has been found to suffer from variance underestimation when
  the dimensionality of the target distribution is high. Recent developments have
  advocated projecting both the score function and the data onto real lines to sidestep
  this issue, although this can severely overestimate the epistemic (model) uncertainty.
  In this work, we propose Grassmann Stein variational gradient descent (GSVGD) as
  an alternative approach, which permits projections onto arbitrary dimensional subspaces.
  Compared with other variants of SVGD that rely on dimensionality reduction, GSVGD
  updates the projectors simultaneously for the score function and the data, and the
  optimal projectors are determined through a coupled Grassmann-valued diffusion process
  which explores favourable subspaces. Both our theoretical and experimental results
  suggest that GSVGD enjoys efficient state-space exploration in high-dimensional
  problems that have an intrinsic low-dimensional structure. "
