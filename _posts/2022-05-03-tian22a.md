title: " Computing D-Stationary Points of $ρ$-Margin Loss SVM "
abstract: " This paper is concerned with the algorithmic aspects of sharper stationarity
  of a nonconvex, nonsmooth, Clarke irregular machine learning model. We study the
  SVM problem with a $\\rho$-margin loss function, which is the margin theory generalization
  bound of SVM introduced in the learning theory textbook by Mohri et al. [2018],
  and has been extensively studied in operations research, statistics, and machine
  learning communities. However, due to its nonconvex, nonsmooth, and irregular nature,
  none of the existing optimization methods can efficiently compute a d(irectional)-stationary
  point, which turns out to be also a local minimum, for the $\\rho$-margin loss SVM
  problem. After a detailed discussion of various nonsmooth stationarity notions,
  we propose a highly efficient nonconvex semi-proximal ADMM-based scheme that provably
  computes d-stationary points and enjoys a local linear convergence rate. We report
  concrete examples to demonstrate the necessity of our assumptions. Numerical results
  verify the effectiveness of the new algorithm and complement our theoretical results. "
