title: " A Dimensionality Reduction Method for Finding Least Favorable Priors with
  a Focus on Bregman Divergence "
abstract: " A common way of characterizing minimax estimators in point estimation
  is by moving the problem into the Bayesian estimation domain and finding a least
  favorable prior distribution. The Bayesian estimator induced by a least favorable
  prior, under mild conditions, is then known to be minimax. However, finding least
  favorable distributions can be challenging due to inherent optimization over the
  space of probability distributions, which is infinite-dimensional. This paper develops
  a dimensionality reduction method that allows us to move the optimization to a finite-dimensional
  setting with an explicit bound on the dimension. The benefit of this dimensionality
  reduction is that it permits the use of popular algorithms such as projected gradient
  ascent to find least favorable priors. Throughout the paper, in order to make progress
  on the problem, we restrict ourselves to Bayesian risks induced by a relatively
  large class of loss functions, namely Bregman divergences. "
