title: " Beyond Data Samples: Aligning Differential Networks Estimation with Scientific
  Knowledge "
abstract: " Learning the differential statistical dependency network between two contexts
  is essential for many real-life applications, mostly in the high dimensional low
  sample regime. In this paper, we propose a novel differential network estimator
  that allows integrating various sources of knowledge beyond data samples. The proposed
  estimator is scalable to a large number of variables and achieves a sharp asymptotic
  convergence rate. Empirical experiments on extensive simulated data and four real-world
  applications (one on neuroimaging and three from functional genomics) show that
  our approach achieves improved differential network estimation and provides better
  supports to downstream tasks like classification. Our results highlight significant
  benefits of integrating group, spatial and anatomic knowledge during differential
  genetic network identification and brain connectome change discovery. "
