title: " CF-GNNExplainer: Counterfactual Explanations for Graph Neural Networks "
abstract: " Given the increasing promise of graph neural networks (GNNs) in real-world
  applications, several methods have been developed for explaining their predictions.
  Existing methods for interpreting predictions from GNNs have primarily focused on
  generating subgraphs that are especially relevant for a particular prediction. However,
  such methods are not counterfactual (CF) in nature: given a prediction, we want
  to understand how the prediction can be changed in order to achieve an alternative
  outcome. In this work, we propose a method for generating CF explanations for GNNs:
  the minimal perturbation to the input (graph) data such that the prediction changes.
  Using only edge deletions, we find that our method, CF-GNNExplainer, can generate
  CF explanations for the majority of instances across three widely used datasets
  for GNN explanations, while removing less than 3 edges on average, with at least
  $94%$ accuracy. This indicates that CF-GNNExplainer primarily removes edges that
  are crucial for the original predictions, resulting in minimal CF explanations. "
