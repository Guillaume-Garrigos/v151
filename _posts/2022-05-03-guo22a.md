title: " Learning Competitive Equilibria in Exchange Economies with Bandit Feedback "
abstract: " The sharing of scarce resources among multiple rational agents is one
  of the classical problems in economics. In exchange economies, which are used to
  model such situations, agents begin with an initial endowment of resources and exchange
  them in a way that is mutually beneficial until they reach a competitive equilibrium
  (CE). The allocations at a CE are Pareto efficient and fair. Consequently, they
  are used widely in designing mechanisms for fair division. However, computing CEs
  requires the knowledge of agent preferences which are unknown in several applications
  of interest. In this work, we explore a new online learning mechanism, which, on
  each round, allocates resources to the agents and collects stochastic feedback on
  their experience in using that allocation. Its goal is to learn the agent utilities
  via this feedback and imitate the allocations at a CE in the long run. We quantify
  CE behavior via two losses and propose a randomized algorithm which achieves sublinear
  loss under a parametric class of utilities. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness
  of this mechanism through numerical simulations. "
