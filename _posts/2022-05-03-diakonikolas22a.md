title: " Hardness of Learning a Single Neuron with Adversarial Label Noise "
abstract: " We study the problem of distribution-free learning of a single neuron
  under adversarial label noise with respect to the squared loss. For a wide range
  of activation functions, including ReLUs and sigmoids, we prove hardness of learning
  results in the Statistical Query model and under a well-studied assumption on the
  complexity of refuting XOR formulas. Specifically, we establish that no polynomial-time
  learning algorithm, even improper, can approximate the optimal loss value within
  any constant factor. "
