title: " On Uncertainty Estimation by Tree-based Surrogate Models in Sequential Model-based
  Optimization "
abstract: " Sequential model-based optimization sequentially selects a candidate point
  by constructing a surrogate model with the history of evaluations, to solve a black-box
  optimization problem. Gaussian process (GP) regression is a popular choice as a
  surrogate model, because of its capability of calculating prediction uncertainty
  analytically. On the other hand, an ensemble of randomized trees is another option
  and has practical merits over GPs due to its scalability and easiness of handling
  continuous/discrete mixed variables. In this paper we revisit various ensembles
  of randomized trees to investigate their behavior in the perspective of prediction
  uncertainty estimation. Then, we propose a new way of constructing an ensemble of
  randomized trees, referred to as BwO forest, where bagging with oversampling is
  employed to construct bootstrapped samples that are used to build randomized trees
  with random splitting. Experimental results demonstrate the validity and good performance
  of BwO forest over existing tree-based models in various circumstances. "
