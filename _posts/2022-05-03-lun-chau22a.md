title: " Learning Inconsistent Preferences with Gaussian Processes "
abstract: " We revisit widely used preferential Gaussian processes (PGP) by Chu and
  Ghahramani [2005] and challenge their modelling assumption that imposes rankability
  of data items via latent utility function values. We propose a generalisation of
  PGP which can capture more expressive latent preferential structures in the data
  and thus be used to model inconsistent preferences, i.e. where transitivity is violated,
  or to discover clusters of comparable items via spectral decomposition of the learned
  preference functions. We also consider the properties of associated covariance kernel
  functions and its reproducing kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), giving a simple construction
  that satisfies universality in the space of preference functions. Finally, we provide
  an extensive set of numerical experiments on simulated and real-world datasets showcasing
  the competitiveness of our proposed method with state-of-the-art. Our experimental
  findings support the conjecture that violations of rankability are ubiquitous in
  real-world preferential data. "
