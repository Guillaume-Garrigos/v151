title: " Online Page Migration with ML Advice "
abstract: " We consider online algorithms for the page migration problem that use
  predictions, potentially imperfect, to improve their performance. The best known
  online algorithms for this problem, due to Westbrook’94 and Bienkowski et al’17,
  have competitive ratios strictly bounded away from 1. In contrast, we show that
  if the algorithm is given a prediction of the input sequence, then it can achieve
  a competitive ratio that tends to $1$ as the prediction error rate tends to $0$.
  Specifically, the competitive ratio is equal to $1+O(q)$, where $q$ is the prediction
  error rate. We also design a “fallback option” that ensures that the competitive
  ratio of the algorithm for any input sequence is at most $O(1/q)$. Our result adds
  to the recent body of work that uses machine learning to improve the performance
  of “classic” algorithms. "
