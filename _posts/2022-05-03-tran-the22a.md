title: " Regret Bounds for Expected Improvement Algorithms in Gaussian Process Bandit
  Optimization "
abstract: " The expected improvement (EI) algorithm is one of the most popular strategies
  for optimization under uncertainty due to its simplicity and efficiency. Despite
  its popularity, the theoretical aspects of this algorithm have not been properly
  analyzed. In particular, whether in the noisy setting, the EI strategy with a standard
  incumbent converges is still an open question of the Gaussian process bandit optimization
  problem. We aim to answer this question by proposing a variant of EI with a standard
  incumbent defined via the GP predictive mean. We prove that our algorithm converges,
  and achieves a cumulative regret bound of $\\mathcal O(\\gamma_T\\sqrt{T})$, where
  $\\gamma_T$ is the maximum information gain between $T$ observations and the Gaussian
  process model. Based on this variant of EI, we further propose an algorithm called
  Improved GP-EI that converges faster than previous counterparts. In particular,
  our proposed variants of EI do not require the knowledge of the RKHS norm and the
  noiseâ€™s sub-Gaussianity parameter as in previous works. Empirical validation in
  our paper demonstrates the effectiveness of our algorithms compared to several baselines. "
