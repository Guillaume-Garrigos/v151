title: " Mode estimation on matrix manifolds: Convergence and robustness "
abstract: " Data on matrix manifolds are ubiquitous on a wide range of research fields.
  The key issue is estimation of the modes (i.e., maxima) of the probability density
  function underlying the data. For instance, local modes (i.e., local maxima) can
  be used for clustering, while the global mode (i.e., the global maximum) is a robust
  alternative to the Frechet mean. Previously, to estimate the modes, an iterative
  method has been proposed based on a Riemannian gradient estimator and empirically
  showed the superior performance in clustering (Ashizawa et al., 2017). However,
  it has not been theoretically investigated if the iterative method is able to capture
  the modes based on the gradient estimator. In this paper, we propose simple iterative
  methods for mode estimation on matrix manifolds based on the Euclidean metric. A
  key contribution is to perform theoretical analysis and establish sufficient conditions
  for the monotonic ascending and convergence of the proposed iterative methods. In
  addition, for the previous method, we prove the monotonic ascending property towards
  a mode. Thus, our work can be also regarded as compensating for the lack of theoretical
  analysis in the previous method. Furthermore, the robustness of the iterative methods
  is theoretically investigated in terms of the breakdown point. Finally, the proposed
  methods are experimentally demonstrated to work well in clustering and robust mode
  estimation on matrix manifolds. "
