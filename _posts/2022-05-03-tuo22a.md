title: " Uncertainty Quantification for Bayesian Optimization "
abstract: " Bayesian optimization is a class of global optimization techniques. In
  Bayesian optimization, the underlying objective function is modeled as a realization
  of a Gaussian process. Although the Gaussian process assumption implies a random
  distribution of the Bayesian optimization outputs, quantification of this uncertainty
  is rarely studied in the literature. In this work, we propose a novel approach to
  assess the output uncertainty of Bayesian optimization algorithms, which proceeds
  by constructing confidence regions of the maximum point (or value) of the objective
  function. These regions can be computed efficiently, and their confidence levels
  are guaranteed by the uniform error bounds for sequential Gaussian process regression
  newly developed in the present work. Our theory provides a unified uncertainty quantification
  framework for all existing sequential sampling policies and stopping criteria. "
